short-description: >
  Docker is a software technology providing operating-system-level virtualization also known as containers.
long-description: >
  Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).
