Generates a front proxy CA client certificate and key for a Kubernetes cluster

### Synopsis

Generates the front proxy client certificate and key and saves them into front-proxy-client.crt and front-proxy-client.key files. 

If both files already exist, kubeadm skips the generation step and existing files will be used. 

Alpha Disclaimer: this command is currently alpha.

```
kubeadm alpha phase certs front-proxy-client [flags]
```

### Options

      --cert-dir string   The path where to save the certificates (default "/etc/kubernetes/pki")
      --config string     Path to kubeadm config file (WARNING: Usage of a configuration file is experimental)
  -h, --help              help for front-proxy-client
```
