long-description: >
  While code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is focused on the holistic acceptance of a contribution.
  Holistic acceptance includes backwards/forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, and others.
  Approver status is scoped to a part of the codebase.
