short-description: >
  An API resource that automatically scales the number of pod replicas based on targeted CPU
  utilization or custom metric targets.
long-description: >
  HPA is typically used with {% glossary_tooltip text="Replication Controllers" term_id="replication-controller" %}, {% glossary_tooltip text="Deployments" term_id="deployment" %}, or Replica Sets.
  It cannot be applied to objects that cannot be scaled, for example {% glossary_tooltip text="DaemonSets" term_id="daemonset" %}.
