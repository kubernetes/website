short-description: >
  An open platform (not Kubernetes-specific) that provides a uniform way to integrate microservices, manage traffic flow, enforce policies, and aggregate telemetry data.
long-description: >
  Adding Istio does not require changing application code.
  It is a layer of infrastructure between a service and the network, which when combined with service deployments, is commonly referred to as a service mesh.
  Istio's control plane abstracts away the underlying cluster management platform, which may be Kubernetes, Mesosphere, etc.
