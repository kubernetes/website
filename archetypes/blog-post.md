Replace this first line of your content with one to three sentences that summarize the blog post.

## This is a section heading

To help the reader, organize your content into sections that contain about three to six paragraphs.

If you're documenting commands, separate the commands from the outputs, like this:

1. Verify that the Secret exists by running the following command:

      ```shell
      kubectl get secrets
      ```

      The response should be like this:

      ```shell
      NAME                    TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
      mysql-pass-c57bb4t7mf   Opaque                                1      9s
      ```
