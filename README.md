# The Kubernetes documentation

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/be93b718-a6df-402a-b4a4-855ba186c97d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-master-staging/deploys) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/kubernetes/website.svg)](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/releases/latest)

This repository contains the assets required to build the [Kubernetes website and documentation](https://kubernetes.io/). We're glad that you want to contribute!

# Using this repository

You can run the website locally using Hugo, or you can run it in a container runtime. We strongly recommend using the container runtime, as it gives deployment consistency with the live website.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
cd website
```

The Kubernetes website uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme). Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:

```
# install dependencies
yarn

# pull in the Docsy submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

## Running the website using a container

To build the site in a container, run the following to build the container image and run it:

```
make container-image
make container-serve
```

Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

## Running the website locally using Hugo

Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L10) file.

To build and test the site locally, run:

```bash
make serve
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files

If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:

```
ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
make: *** [serve] Error 1
```

Try checking the current limit for open files:

`launchctl limit maxfiles`

Then run the following commands (adapted from https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c):

```

sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons

sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

This works for Catalina as well as Mojave macOS.

# Contributing to the docs

You can click the **Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. This copy is called a *fork*. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request to let us know about it.

Once your pull request is created, a Kubernetes reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback.  As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the Kubernetes reviewer.**

Also, note that you may end up having more than one Kubernetes reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a Kubernetes reviewer that is different than the one initially assigned to provide you feedback.

Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a Kubernetes tech reviewer when needed.  Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
