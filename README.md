[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/be93b718-a6df-402a-b4a4-855ba186c97d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-master-staging/deploys) [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/kubernetes/website.svg)](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/releases/latest)

This repository contains the assets required to build the [Kubernetes website and documentation](https://kubernetes.io/). We're glad that you want to contribute!

# Using this repository

You can run the website locally using Hugo (Extended version), or you can run it in a container runtime. We strongly recommend using the container runtime, as it gives deployment consistency with the live website.

## Prerequisites

To use this repository, you need the following installed locally:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Hugo (Extended version)](https://gohugo.io/)
- A container runtime, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Before you start, install the dependencies. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
cd website
```

The Kubernetes website uses the [Docsy Hugo theme](https://github.com/google/docsy#readme). Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:

```
# pull in the Docsy submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

## Running the website using a container

To build the site in a container, run the following to build the container image and run it:

```
make container-image
make container-serve
```

Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

## Running the website locally using Hugo

Make sure to install the Hugo extended version specified by the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml#L10) file.

To build and test the site locally, run:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm ci
make serve
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the website. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the website and forces a browser refresh.

## Building the API reference pages

The API reference pages located in `content/en/docs/reference/kubernetes-api` are built from the Swagger specification, using https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/reference-docs/tree/master/gen-resourcesdocs.

To update the reference pages for a new Kubernetes release (replace v1.20 in the following examples with the release to update to):

1. Pull the `kubernetes-resources-reference` submodule:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

2. Create a new API revision into the submodule, and add the Swagger specification:

```
mkdir api-ref-generator/gen-resourcesdocs/api/v1.20
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json' > api-ref-generator/gen-resourcesdocs/api/v1.20/swagger.json
```

3. Copy the table of contents and fields configuration for the new release from a previous one:

```
mkdir api-ref-generator/gen-resourcesdocs/api/v1.20
cp api-ref-generator/gen-resourcesdocs/api/v1.19/* api-ref-generator/gen-resourcesdocs/api/v1.20/
```

4. Adapt the files `toc.yaml` and `fields.yaml` to reflect the changes between the two releases

5. Next, build the pages:

```
make api-reference
```

You can test the results locally by making and serving the site from a container image:

```
make container-image
make container-serve
```

In a web browser, go to http://localhost:1313/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/ to view the API reference.

6. When all changes of the new contract are reflected into the configuration files `toc.yaml` and `fields.yaml`, create a Pull Request with the newly generated API reference pages.

## Troubleshooting
### error: failed to transform resource: TOCSS: failed to transform "scss/main.scss" (text/x-scss): this feature is not available in your current Hugo version

Hugo is shipped in two set of binaries for technical reasons. The current website runs based on the **Hugo Extended** version only. In the [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) look for archives with `extended` in the name. To confirm, run `hugo version` and look for the word `extended`.

### Troubleshooting macOS for too many open files

If you run `make serve` on macOS and receive the following error:

```
ERROR 2020/08/01 19:09:18 Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:1313: socket: too many open files
make: *** [serve] Error 1
```

Try checking the current limit for open files:

`launchctl limit maxfiles`

Then run the following commands (adapted from https://gist.github.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c):

```shell
#!/bin/sh

# These are the original gist links, linking to my gists now.

# curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/a2ikm/761c2ab02b7b3935679e55af5d81786a/raw/ab644cb92f216c019a2f032bbf25e258b01d87f9/limit.maxproc.plist

curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c/raw/ed73cacf82906fdde59976a0c8248cce8b44f906/limit.maxfiles.plist
curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tombigel/d503800a282fcadbee14b537735d202c/raw/ed73cacf82906fdde59976a0c8248cce8b44f906/limit.maxproc.plist

sudo mv limit.maxfiles.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
sudo mv limit.maxproc.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons

sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxproc.plist

sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/limit.maxfiles.plist
```

This works for Catalina as well as Mojave macOS.

# Contributing to the docs

You can click the **Fork** button in the upper-right area of the screen to create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account. This copy is called a *fork*. Make any changes you want in your fork, and when you are ready to send those changes to us, go to your fork and create a new pull request to let us know about it.

Once your pull request is created, a Kubernetes reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback.  As the owner of the pull request, **it is your responsibility to modify your pull request to address the feedback that has been provided to you by the Kubernetes reviewer.**

Also, note that you may end up having more than one Kubernetes reviewer provide you feedback or you may end up getting feedback from a Kubernetes reviewer that is different than the one initially assigned to provide you feedback.

Furthermore, in some cases, one of your reviewers might ask for a technical review from a Kubernetes tech reviewer when needed.  Reviewers will do their best to provide feedback in a timely fashion but response time can vary based on circumstances.
