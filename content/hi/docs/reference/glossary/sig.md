Members within a SIG have a shared interest in advancing a specific area, such as architecture, API machinery, or documentation.
SIGs must follow the SIG [governance guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md), but can have their own contribution policy and channels of communication.

For more information, see the [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) repo and the current list of [SIGs and Working Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).
