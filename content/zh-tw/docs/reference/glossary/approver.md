<!--
 A person who can review and approve Kubernetes code contributions.
-->
 能夠審覈並批准 Kubernetes 代碼貢獻的人。

<!--more--> 

<!--
While code review is focused on code quality and correctness, approval is focused on the holistic acceptance of a contribution. Holistic acceptance includes backwards/forwards compatibility, adhering to API and flag conventions, subtle performance and correctness issues, interactions with other parts of the system, and others. Approver status is scoped to a part of the codebase. Approvers were previously referred to as maintainers.
-->
代碼審覈的重點是代碼質量和正確性，而批准的重點是對貢獻的整體接受。
整體接受包括向後/向前兼容性、遵守 API 和參數約定、細微的性能和正確性問題、與系統其他部分的交互等。
批准者狀態的作用域是代碼庫的一部分。審批者以前被稱爲維護者。
