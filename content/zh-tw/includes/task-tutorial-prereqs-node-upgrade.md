<!--
You need to have shell access to all the nodes, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial 
on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.

你必須有 Shell 能訪問所有節點，且必須設定 kubectl 命令列工具讓其與你的叢集通信。
建議運行本教程的叢集至少有兩個節點，且這兩個節點不能作爲控制平面主機。
