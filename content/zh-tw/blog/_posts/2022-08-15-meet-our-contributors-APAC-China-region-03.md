Hello, everyone 👋

Welcome back to the third edition of the "Meet Our Contributors" blog post series for APAC.

This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project.

So, without further ado, let's get straight to the article.
-->
大家好 👋

歡迎來到亞太地區的 “認識我們的貢獻者” 博文系列第三期。

這篇博文介紹了四名來自中國的優秀貢獻者，他們在上游 Kubernetes 項目中扮演了不同的領導角色和社區角色。

閒話少說，讓我們直接進入正文。

## [Andy Zhang](https://github.com/andyzhangx)

<!--
Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago.

He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code.
-->
Andy Zhang 目前就職於微軟中國上海辦事處，他主要關注 Kubernetes 儲存驅動。
Andy 大約在 5 年前開始爲 Kubernetes 做貢獻。

他說由於自己爲 Azure Kubernetes Service 團隊工作，所以大部分時間都在爲 Kubernetes 社區項目做貢獻。
現在他是很多 Kubernetes 子項目的主要貢獻者，例如 Kubernetes cloud-provider 倉庫的代碼。

<!--
His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects.

Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.
-->
他的開源貢獻主要是出於自我激勵。在過去的兩年裏，他通過 LFX Mentorship 計劃指導了一些學生爲 Kubernetes 做貢獻，
其中一些學生憑藉 Kubernetes 項目積累的專業知識和貢獻經歷而找到了工作。

Andy 是 Kubernetes 中國社區的活躍成員。
他補充說，Kubernetes 社區對如何成爲 Member、Code Reviewer、Approver 有完善的指導說明，
後來他發現一些開源項目還處於非常早期的階段，他積極地爲這些項目做了貢獻併成爲了項目維護者。

## [Shiming Zhang](https://github.com/wzshiming)

<!--
Shiming Zhang is a Software Engineer working on Kubernetes for DaoCloud in Shanghai, China.

He has mostly been involved with SIG Node as a reviewer. His major contributions have mainly been bug fixes and feature improvements in an ongoing [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2712-pod-priority-based-graceful-node-shutdown), all revolving around SIG Node.

Some of his major PRs are [fixing watchForLockfileContention memory leak](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100326), [fixing startupProbe behaviour](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101093), [adding Field status.hostIPs for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2661).
-->
Shiming Zhang 是一名軟體工程師，供職於中國上海道客網路科技。

他主要以 Reviewer 的身份參與 SIG Node。他的主要貢獻集中在當下的
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2712-pod-priority-based-graceful-node-shutdown)
的漏洞修復和功能優化，這些工作全部圍繞 SIG Node 展開。

他發起的一些主要 PR 有
[fixing watchForLockfileContention memory leak](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100326)、
[fixing startupProbe behaviour](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101093)、
[adding Field status.hostIPs for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2661)。

## [Paco Xu](https://github.com/pacoxu)

<!--
Paco Xu works at DaoCloud, a Shanghai-based cloud-native firm. He works with the infra and the open source team, focusing on enterprise cloud native platforms based on Kubernetes.

He started with Kubernetes in early 2017 and his first contribution was in March 2018. He started with a bug that he found, but his solution was not that graceful, hence wasn't accepted. He then started with some good first issues, which helped him to a great extent. In addition to this, from 2016 to 2017, he made some minor contributions to Docker.
-->
Paco Xu 就職於上海的一家雲原生公司：道客網路科技。
他與基礎設施和開源團隊合作，專注於基於 Kubernetes 的企業雲原生平臺。

他在 2017 年初開始使用 Kubernetes，他的第一個貢獻是在 2018 年 3 月。
他的貢獻始於自己發現的一個漏洞，但當時他的解決方案不是那麼優雅，因此沒有被接受。
然後他從一些 Good First Issue 開始做貢獻，這在很大程度上幫助了他。
除此之外，在 2016 到 2017 年間，他還對 Docker 做出了一些小貢獻。

<!--
Currently, Paco is a reviewer for `kubeadm` (a SIG Cluster Lifecycle product), and for SIG Node.

Paco says that you should contribute to open source projects you use. For him, an open source project is like a book to learn, getting inspired through discussions with the project maintainers.

> In my opinion, the best way for me is learning how owners work on the project.
-->
目前，Paco 是 `kubeadm`（一個 SIG Cluster Lifecycle 產品）和 SIG Node 的 Reviewer。

Paco 說大家應該爲自己使用的開源項目做貢獻。
對他來說，開源項目就像一本要學習的書，通過與項目維護者們討論可以獲得啓發。

> 在我看來，對我來說最好的方式是學習項目所有者如何處理項目。

## [Jintao Zhang](https://github.com/tao12345666333)

<!--
Jintao Zhang is presently employed at API7, where he focuses on ingress and service mesh.

In 2017, he encountered an issue which led to a community discussion and his contributions to Kubernetes started. Before contributing to Kubernetes, Jintao was a long-time contributor to Docker-related open source projects.
-->
Jintao Zhang 目前受聘於 API7，他專注於 Ingress 和服務網格。

2017 年，他遇到了一個引發社區討論的問題，並開始了對 Kubernetes 做貢獻。
在爲 Kubernetes 做貢獻之前，Jintao 是 Docker 相關開源項目的長期貢獻者。

<!--
Currently Jintao is a maintainer for the [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) project.

He suggests keeping track of job opportunities at open source companies so that you can find one that allows you to contribute full time. For new contributors Jintao says that if anyone wants to make a significant contribution to an open source project, then they should choose the project based on their interests and should generously invest time.
-->
目前 Jintao 是 [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) 項目的 Maintainer。

他建議關注開源公司的工作機會，這樣你就可以找到一個可以讓你全職貢獻的機會。
對於新的貢獻者們，Jintao 表示如果有人想爲一個開源項目做重大貢獻，
那麼應該根據自己的興趣選擇項目，然後應該慷慨地投入時間。
