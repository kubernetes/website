<h2>Challenge</h2>

<p>In recent years, the adidas team was happy with its software choices from a technology perspective—but accessing all of the tools was a problem. For instance, "just to get a developer VM, you had to send a request form, give the purpose, give the title of the project, who's responsible, give the internal cost center a call so that they can do recharges," says Daniel Eichten, Senior Director of Platform Engineering. "The best case is you got your machine in half an hour. Worst case is half a week or sometimes even a week."</p>

<h2>挑戰</h2>

<p>近年來，阿迪達斯團隊對其從技術角度所選用的軟件都比較滿意，但怎麼訪問所有軟件工具成了一個難題。比如說，
“只是想要一臺開發者虛機，你就必須提交一個申請表，說明用途，給出項目的名稱，誰是負責人，致電通知內部成本中心方便他們進行費用結算。”
平臺工程高級總監 Daniel Eichten 舉例說。“即使一切順利，最快半小時才能獲得機器，最慢則需要三天甚至一週。”</p>

<!-- 
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>To improve the process, "we started from the developer point of view," and looked for ways to shorten the time it took to get a project up and running and into the adidas infrastructure, says Senior Director of Platform Engineering Fernando Cornago. They found the solution with containerization, agile development, continuous delivery, and a cloud native platform that includes Kubernetes and Prometheus.</p>

<h2>解決方案</h2>

<p>爲了改善這個流程，“我們從開發者的角度出發”，嘗試了各種方式來縮短從項目啓動到跑起來並進入 阿迪達斯基礎設施所花費的時間，
平臺工程高級總監 Fernando Cornago 說。他們找到了容器化、敏捷開發、持續交付以及通過 Kubernetes 和 Prometheus 構成的雲原生平臺解決方案。</p>

<!-- 
<h2>Impact</h2>

<p>Just six months after the project began, 100% of the adidas e-commerce site was running on Kubernetes. Load time for the e-commerce site was reduced by half. Releases went from every 4-6 weeks to 3-4 times a day. With 4,000 pods, 200 nodes, and 80,000 builds per month, adidas is now running 40% of its most critical, impactful systems on its cloud native platform.</p> 
-->
<h2>成效</h2>

<p>項目啓動僅六個月後，阿迪達斯的電商網站就全部運行在了 Kubernetes 上。電商網站的加載時間減少了一半。
發佈頻率從每 4 到 6 周發佈一次變爲每天發佈 3 到 4 次。
阿迪達斯現在在其雲原生平臺上運行着 40% 的最關鍵、最具影響力的系統，擁有 4,000 個 Pod、200 個節點和每月 80,000 次構建。</p>

"For me, Kubernetes is a platform made by engineers for engineers. It's relieving the development team from tasks that they don't want to do, but at the same time giving the visibility of what is behind the curtain, so they can also control it."

“對我而言，Kubernetes 是一個工程師們爲自己量身打造的平臺。
它將開發團隊從不想做的任務中解脫出來，同時提供了後臺監測大屏，方便開發團隊控制運行的進程。”

<p>For engineers at adidas, says Daniel Eichten, Senior Director of Platform Engineering, "it felt like being an artist with your hands tied behind your back, and you're supposed to paint something."</p> 
-->
<p>Daniel Eichten 說：“對於 阿迪達斯的工程師，這就像是一位藝術家雙手被綁縛在背後，卻要人家畫出作品。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>For instance, "just to get a developer VM, you had to send a request form, give the purpose, give the title of the project, who's responsible, give the internal cost center a call so that they can do recharges," says Eichten. "Eventually, after a ton of approvals, then the provisioning of the machine happened within minutes, and then the best case is you got your machine in half an hour. Worst case is half a week or sometimes even a week."</p> 
-->
<p>例如，“只是想要一臺開發者虛機，你就必須提交一個申請表，說明用途，給出項目的名稱，誰是負責人，致電通知內部成本中心方便他們進行費用結算。”
Eichten 說。“最終，在經歷了一堆審批後，虛機的製備在幾分鐘內完成，最好的情況是你的虛機在半小時內就能到位。最糟的情況要半周，有時甚至是一週。”</p>

"I call our cloud native platform the field of dreams. We built it, and we never anticipated that people would come and just love it."

“我把我們的雲原生平臺稱爲夢想之地。我們構建了這個平臺，從未預料到人們會蜂擁而至並愛上它。”

<!-- 
<p>"We were engineers before," adds Eichten. "We know what a typical engineer needs, is craving for, what he or she doesn't want to take care of. For us it was pretty clear. We filled the gaps that no one wants to take care of, and we make the stuff that is usually painful as painless as possible." The goals: to improve speed, operability, and observability.</p> 
-->
<p>“我們以前是工程師，”Eichten 補充道。“我們知道傳統的工程師需要什麼，渴望什麼，什麼是他們不想處理的。
對我們來說，這很清楚。我們填補了沒有人想處理的空白，並儘可能地將以前痛苦難辦的事情變得輕鬆無痛。”
目標是提高速度、可操作性和可觀測性。</p>

<!-- 
<p>Cornago and Eichten found the solution with containerization, agile development, continuous delivery, and a cloud native platform that includes Kubernetes and Prometheus. "Choosing Kubernetes was pretty clear," says Eichten. "Day zero, deciding, easy. Day one, installing, configuring, easy. Day two, keeping it up and running even with small workloads, if something goes wrong, you don't know how these things work in detail, you're lost. For day two problems, we needed a partner who's helping us."</p> 
-->
<p>Cornago 和 Eichten 找到了容器化、敏捷開發、持續交付以及通過 Kubernetes 和 Prometheus 構建的雲原生平臺解決方案。
“選擇 Kubernetes 是顯而易見的，”Eichten 說。
“第一天，做決定，簡單。第二天，安裝、配置，簡單。第三天，啓動並運行小的負載。
如果出現問題，你不知道這些東西的詳細工作原理，你會茫然失措。對於第三天的問題，我們需要一個提供幫助的合作伙伴。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>In early 2017, adidas chose Giant Swarm to consult, install, configure, and run all of its Kubernetes clusters in AWS and on premise. "There is no competitive edge over our competitors like Puma or Nike in running and operating a Kubernetes cluster," says Eichten. "Our competitive edge is that we teach our internal engineers how to build cool e-comm stores that are fast, that are resilient, that are running perfectly."</p> 
-->
<p>2017 年初，阿迪達斯選擇 Giant Swarm 來諮詢、安裝、配置和運行其在 AWS 和本地的所有 Kubernetes 集羣。
“在運維 Kubernetes 集羣方面，我們與 Puma 或 Nike 等競爭對手相比沒有競爭優勢，”
Eichten 說。“我們的競爭優勢在於我們教會了內部工程師們如何構建快速、可靠、運行完美的電商店鋪。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>Case in point: For Cyber Week, the team has to create a lot of custom metrics. In November 2017, "because we used the same Prometheus that we use for monitoring the cluster, we really filled the Prometheus database, and we were not able to reduce the retention period [enough]," says Cornago. So during the freeze period before the peak shopping week, five engineers from the platform team worked with five engineers from the e-comm team to figure out a federated solution that was implemented in two days.</p> 
-->
<p>值得一提的是：在網絡購物周，團隊必須創建許多自定義指標。在 2017 年 11 月，
“因爲我們使用了同一個 Prometheus 監控集羣，我們真得填滿了 Prometheus 數據庫，無法將保留期減少到足夠的程度，”Cornago 說。
因此，在高峯購物周之前的凍結期，來自平臺團隊的五名工程師與來自電商團隊的五名工程師合作，找到了一個在兩天內實現的聯合解決方案。</p>

<!-- 
<p>In addition to being ready for Cyber Week—100% of the adidas e-commerce site was running on Kubernetes then, just six months after the project began—the cloud native stack has had other impressive results. Load time for the e-commerce site was reduced by half. Releases went from every 4-6 weeks to 3-4 times a day. With 4,000 pods, 200 nodes, and 80,000 builds per month, adidas is now running 40% of its most critical, impactful systems on its cloud native platform.</p>

<p>除了爲網絡購物周做準備，在項目啓動後僅六個月，阿迪達斯的所有電商網站都運行在了 Kubernetes 上。
雲原生堆棧還取得了其他令人印象深刻的成果。電商網站的加載時間減少了一半。
發佈頻率從每 4 到 6 周發佈一次變爲每天發佈 3 到 4 次。
阿迪達斯現在在其雲原生平臺上運行着 40% 最關鍵、最具影響力的系統，擁有 4,000 個 Pod、200 個節點和每月 80,000 次構建。</p>

<!-- 
<p>And adoption has spread quickly among adidas's 300-strong engineering corps. "I call our cloud native platform the field of dreams," says Eichten. "We built it, and we never anticipated that people would come and just love it."</p> 
-->
<p>而且這個平臺的採用迅速在阿迪達斯 300 個工程團隊中傳播。
“我把我們的雲原生平臺稱爲夢想之地，”Eichten 說。“我們構建了這個平臺，從未預料到人們會蜂擁而至並愛上它。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>For one thing, "everybody who can touch a line of code" has spent one full week onboarding and learning the platform with members of the 35-person platform engineering team, says Cornago. "We try to spend 50% of our time sitting with the teams, because this is the only way to understand how our platform is being used. And this is how the teams will feel safe that there is someone on the other side of the wall, also feeling the pain."</p> 
-->
<p>首先，“每個能夠接觸到代碼的人”都會用一整週的時間向 35 人組成的平臺工程團隊成員學習並完成上崗培訓，Cornago 說。
“我們嘗試花 50% 的時間與這些團隊坐在一起，因爲這是理解平臺如何運作的唯一方法。
這也是讓這些團隊感到安全的方式，讓他們知道在牆的另一邊，有一些人依然在處理這些讓他們感到頭痛的難題。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>Additionally, Cornago and Eichten took advantage of the fact that as a fashion athletic wear brand, adidas has sports and competition in its DNA. "Top-down mandates don't work at adidas, but gamification works," says Cornago. "So this year we had a DevOps Cup competition. Every team created new technical capabilities and had a hypothesis of how this affected business value. We announced the winner at a big internal tech summit with more than 600 people. It's been really, really useful for the teams."</p> 
-->
<p>此外，Cornago 和 Eichten 利用作爲時尚運動品牌的特點，阿迪達斯將運動和競爭沉澱在其基因中。
“自上而下的行政指令在阿迪達斯不起作用，但遊戲化的做法有效，”Cornago 說。“因此，今年我們舉辦了 DevOps 杯比賽。
每個團隊創造了新的技術能力，並假設這些能力如何影響商業價值。
我們在一個有 600 多人蔘加的大型內部技術峯會上宣佈了獲勝者。這對團隊真得非常有幫助。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>So if they had any advice for other companies looking to start a cloud native journey, it would be this: "There is no one-size-fits-all for all companies," says Cornago. "Apply your company's culture to everything that you do."</p> 
-->
<p>最後如果對其他希望開始雲原生之旅的公司提一些建議，那就是：
“沒有放之四海而皆準的方案，”Cornago 說。“關鍵是將企業文化基因融入技術轉型的每個環節。”</p>
