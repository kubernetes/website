Kubernetes can run on various platforms: from your laptop, to VMs on a cloud provider, to a rack of
bare metal servers. The effort required to set up a cluster varies from running a single command to
crafting your own customized cluster. Use this guide to choose a solution that fits your needs.

If you just want to "kick the tires" on Kubernetes, use the [local Docker-based solutions](#local-machine-solutions).

When you are ready to scale up to more machines and higher availability, a [hosted solution](#hosted-solutions) is the easiest to create and maintain.

[Turnkey cloud solutions](#turnkey-cloud-solutions) require only a few commands to create
and cover a wide range of cloud providers. [On-Premises turnkey cloud solutions](#on-premises-turnkey-cloud-solutions) have the simplicity of the turnkey cloud solution combined with the security of your own private network.

If you already have a way to configure hosting resources, use [kubeadm](/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/) to easily bring up a cluster with a single command per machine.

[Custom solutions](#custom-solutions) vary from step-by-step instructions to general advice for setting up
a Kubernetes cluster from scratch.

## 사용자 지정 솔루션

Kubernetes can run on a wide range of Cloud providers and bare-metal environments, and with many
base operating systems.

If you can find a guide below that matches your needs, use it. It may be a little out of date, but
it will be easier than starting from scratch. If you do want to start from scratch, either because you
have special requirements, or just because you want to understand what is underneath a Kubernetes
cluster, try the [Getting Started from Scratch](/docs/setup/scratch/) guide.

If you are interested in supporting Kubernetes on a new platform, see
[Writing a Getting Started Guide](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/writing-a-getting-started-guide.md).

{{< note >}}
**Note:** The above table is ordered by version test/used in nodes, followed by support level.
{{< /note >}}

### 열 정의

* **IaaS Provider** is the product or organization which provides the virtual or physical machines (nodes) that Kubernetes runs on.
* **OS** is the base operating system of the nodes.
* **Config. Mgmt.** is the configuration management system that helps install and maintain Kubernetes on the
  nodes.
* **Networking** is what implements the [networking model](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/). Those with networking type
  _none_ may not support more than a single node, or may support multiple VM nodes in a single physical node.
* **Conformance** indicates whether a cluster created with this configuration has passed the project's conformance
  tests for supporting the API and base features of Kubernetes v1.0.0.
* **Support Levels**
  * **Project**: Kubernetes committers regularly use this configuration, so it usually works with the latest release
    of Kubernetes.
  * **Commercial**: A commercial offering with its own support arrangements.
  * **Community**: Actively supported by community contributions. May not work with recent releases of Kubernetes.
  * **Inactive**: Not actively maintained. Not recommended for first-time Kubernetes users, and may be removed.
* **Notes** has other relevant information, such as the version of Kubernetes used.
