<h2><!--Challenge-->挑战</h2>

<p>
<!--
A household name in high-quality audio equipment, <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html">Bose</a> has offered connected products for more than five years, and as that demand grew, the infrastructure had to change to support it. "We needed to provide a mechanism for developers to rapidly prototype and deploy services all the way to production pretty fast," says Lead Cloud Engineer Josh West. In 2016, the company decided to start building a platform from scratch. The primary goal: "To be one to two steps ahead of the different product groups so that we are never scrambling to catch up with their scale," says Cloud Architecture Manager Dylan O'Mahony.

作为一家以高品质音频设备闻名的公司，[Bose](https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html)
已经提供了超过五年的联网产品，随着这一需求的增长，基础设施不得不改变以支持它。
“我们需要为开发者提供一种机制，能够快速原型化并部署服务一直到生产环境”，首席云工程师 Josh West 说道。
2016年，公司决定开始从头构建一个平台。其主要目标是：“要领先于各个产品组一到两步，这样我们就永远不会匆忙追赶他们的规模”，
云架构经理 Dylan O'Mahony 说道。

<h2><!--Solution-->解决方案</h2>

<p>
<!--
From the beginning, the team knew it wanted a microservices architecture. After evaluating and prototyping a couple of orchestration solutions, the team decided to adopt <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> for its scaled IoT Platform-as-a-Service running on AWS. The platform, which also incorporated Prometheus monitoring, launched in production in 2017, serving over 3 million connected products from the get-go. Bose has since adopted a number of other CNCF technologies, including <a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">Fluentd</a>, <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>, <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, and <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>.
-->
从一开始，团队就知道他们想要一个微服务架构。在评估并原型化了几种编排解决方案后，
团队决定为其在 AWS 上运行的规模化 IoT 平台即服务（Platform-as-a-Service）采用
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)。该平台还集成了 Prometheus 监控，并于2017年投入生产，
一开始就服务于超过300万的联网产品。自那时以来，Bose 已经采用了多项其他 CNCF 技术，包括
[Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/)、[CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/)、[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)
和 [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/)。
</p>

<h2><!--Impact-->影响</h2>

<p>
<!--
With about 100 engineers onboarded, the platform is now enabling 30,000 non-production deployments across dozens of microservices per year. In 2018, there were 1250+ production deployments. Just one production cluster holds 1,800 namespaces and 340 worker nodes. "We had a brand new service taken from concept through coding and deployment all the way to production, including hardening, security testing and so forth, in less than two and a half weeks," says O'Mahony.
-->
随着大约 100 名工程师的加入，该平台现在每年支持跨数十个微服务的 30,000 次非生产部署。
2018 年，有超过 1250 次生产部署。仅一个生产集群就包含 1,800 个命名空间和 340 个工作节点。
“我们有一个全新的服务，从概念、编码、部署一直到生产，包括强化、安全测试等，整个过程不到两个半星期”，O'Mahony 说道。

"At Bose we're building an IoT platform that has enabled our physical products. If it weren't for Kubernetes and the rest of the CNCF projects being free open source software with such a strong community, we would never have achieved scale, or even gotten to launch on schedule."

The primary goal: "To be one to two steps ahead of the different product groups so that we are never scrambling to catch up with their scale," says Cloud Architecture Manager Dylan O'Mahony. "If they release a new connected product, we want to be already well ahead of being able to handle whatever scale that they're going to throw at us."

2016年，公司决定开始从头构建一个物联网平台。其主要目标是：“要领先于各个产品组一到两步，

From the beginning, the team knew it wanted a microservices architecture and platform as a service. After evaluating and prototyping orchestration solutions, including Mesos and Docker Swarm, the team decided to adopt <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> for its platform running on AWS. Kubernetes was still in 1.5, but already the technology could do much of what the team wanted and needed for the present and the future. For West, that meant having storage and network handled. O'Mahony points to Kubernetes' portability in case Bose decides to go multi-cloud.

从一开始，团队就知道他们想要一个微服务架构和平台即服务。在评估并原型化了包括 Mesos 和 Docker Swarm
在内的编排解决方案后，团队决定为其运行在 AWS 上的平台采用 [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)。
当时 Kubernetes 仍处于1.5版本，但该技术已经能够满足团队当前和未来大部分的需求。对于 West 来说，
这意味着存储和网络得到了处理。O'Mahony 强调了 Kubernetes 的可移植性，以防 Bose 决定采用多云策略。
</p>

<p>
<!--
"Bose is a company that looks out for the long term," says West. "Going with a quick commercial off-the-shelf solution might've worked for that point in time, but it would not have carried us forward, which is what we needed from Kubernetes and the CNCF."
-->
“Bose 是一家着眼于长远的公司，”West 说道，
“采用一个快速的现成商业解决方案可能在当时适用，但它无法支持我们向前发展，
而这是我们从 Kubernetes 和 CNCF 得到的。”

"Everybody on the team thinks in terms of automation, leaning out the processes, getting things done as quickly as possible. When you step back and look at what it means for a 50-plus-year-old speaker company to have that sort of culture, it really is quite incredible, and I think the tools that we use and the foundation that we've built with them is a huge piece of that."

The team spent time working on choosing tooling to make the experience easier for developers. "Our developers interact with tools provided by our Ops team, and the Ops team run all of their tooling on top of Kubernetes," says O'Mahony. "We try not to make direct Kubernetes access the only way. In fact, ideally, our developers wouldn't even need to know that they're running on Kubernetes."
-->
团队花费时间选择工具，以使开发者的体验更加轻松。“我们的开发者与由我们的运维团队提供的工具进行交互，
而运维团队在 Kubernetes 上运行他们所有的工具”，O'Mahony 说道，“我们尽量避免将直接的 Kubernetes
访问作为唯一途径。实际上，理想情况下，我们的开发者甚至不需要知道他们在 Kubernetes 上运行。”

The platform, which also incorporated <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> monitoring from the beginning, backdoored its way into production in 2017, serving over 3 million connected products from the get-go. "Even though the speakers and the products that we were designing this platform for were still quite a ways away from being launched, we did have some connected speakers on the market," says O'Mahony. "We basically started to point certain features of those speakers and the apps that go with those speakers to this platform."
-->
该平台从一开始就集成了 [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) 监控，并于2017年通过后门方式进入生产环境，
一开始就服务于超过300万的联网产品。“即使我们为设计这个平台的音箱和产品离正式发布还有一段时间，
但我们确实已经在市场上有一些联网音箱”，O'Mahony 说道，“我们基本上开始将这些音箱的某些功能及其配套应用指向这个平台。”

Today, just one of Bose's production clusters holds 1,800 namespaces/discrete services and 340 nodes. With about 100 engineers now onboarded, the platform infrastructure is now enabling 30,000 non-production deployments across dozens of microservices per year. In 2018, there were 1250+ production deployments.. It's a staggering improvement over some of Bose's previous deployment processes, which supported far fewer deployments and services.

如今，仅 Bose 的一个生产集群就包含 1800 个命名空间/独立服务和 340 个节点。
随着现在约有 100 名工程师加入，该平台基础设施现在每年支持跨数十个微服务的 30,000
次非生产部署。2018 年，进行了超过 1250 次生产部署。与 Bose 之前支持远少次数的部署和服务的部署流程相比，
这是一个惊人的改进。

Many of those technologies—such as <a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">Fluentd</a>, <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a>, <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">Jaeger</a>, and <a href="https://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>—come from the <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF Landscape</a>, which West and O'Mahony have relied upon throughout Bose's cloud native journey. "The CNCF Landscape quickly explains what's going on in all the different areas from storage to cloud providers to automation and so forth," says West.

Another benefit of going cloud native: "We are even attracting much more talent into Bose because we're so involved with the <a href="http://careers.bose.com">CNCF Landscape</a>," says West. (Yes, they're hiring.) "It's just enabled so many people to do so many great things and really brought Bose into the future of cloud."

转向云原生的另一个好处是：“我们甚至吸引了更多的人才加入 Bose，因为我们深入参与到

In the coming year, the team wants to work on service mesh and serverless, as well as expansion around the world. "Getting our latency down by going multi-region is going to be a big focus for us," says O'Mahony. "In order to make sure that our customers in Japan, Australia, and everywhere else are having a good experience, we want to have points of presence closer to them. It's never been done at Bose before."

在即将到来的一年里，团队希望在服务网格和无服务器方面进行工作，并在全球范围内扩展。

That won't stop them, because the team is all about lofty goals. "We want to get to billions of connected products!" says West.

It's only because of the cloud native landscape and the tools and the features that are available that we can provide such a fantastic cloud platform for all the developers and divisions that are trying to enable some pretty amazing experiences."

In fact, given the scale the platform is already supporting, says O'Mahony, "doing anything other than Kubernetes, I think, would be folly at this point."
