<h2>解决方案</h2>

<!-- 
<p>After embracing a DevOps transformation and launching a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) project four years ago, the company reduced its deployment time from three months to 30 minutes. But they wanted to go even faster across environments, so they began their cloud native journey, adopting Docker containers orchestrated with <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>.</p>
-->
<p>在四年前采用 DevOps 转型并启动持续集成/部署 (CI/CD)项目后，该公司将部署时间从 3 个月缩短到 30 分钟。但是他们想在部署环境上走得更快，所以他们开始他们的云原生之旅，采用与 <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> 协调的 Docker 容器。</p>

<h2>影响</h2>

<!-- 
<p>Nordstrom Technology developers using Kubernetes now deploy faster and can "just focus on writing applications," says Dhawal Patel, a senior engineer on the team building a Kubernetes enterprise platform for Nordstrom. Furthermore, the team has increased Ops efficiency, improving CPU utilization from 5x to 12x depending on the workload. "We run thousands of virtual machines (VMs), but aren't effectively using all those resources," says Patel. "With Kubernetes, without even trying to make our cluster efficient, we are currently at a 10x increase."</p>
-->
<p>为 Nordstrom 构建 Kubernetes 企业平台的团队高级工程师 Dhawal Patel 说，“使用 Kubernetes 的 Nordstrom 技术开发人员现在项目部署得更快，并且能够只专注于编写应用程序。”此外，该团队还提高了运营效率，根据工作负载将 CPU 利用率从 5 倍提高到 12 倍。Patel 说：“我们运行了数千台虚拟机（VM），但无法有效地使用所有这些资源。借助 Kubernetes，我们甚至不需要尝试去提高集群的效率，就能使运营效率增长 10 倍。”</p>

<p>When Dhawal Patel joined <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/">Nordstrom</a> five years ago as an application developer for the retailer's website, he realized there was an opportunity to help speed up development cycles.</p> -->
<p>当 Dhawal Patel 五年前加入 <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/">Nordstrom</a>，担任该零售商网站的应用程序开发人员时，他意识到有机会帮助加快开发周期。</p>

<!-- 
<p>In those early DevOps days, Nordstrom Technology still followed a traditional model of silo teams and functions. "As a developer, I was spending more time fixing environments than writing code and adding value to business," Patel says. "I was passionate about that—so I was given the opportunity to help fix it."</p>
-->
<p>在早期的 DevOps 时代，Nordstrom 技术仍然遵循传统的孤岛团队和功能模型。Patel 说：“作为开发人员，我花在维护环境上的时间比编写代码和为业务增加价值的时间要多。我对此充满热情，因此我有机会参与帮助修复它。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>The company was eager to move faster, too, and in 2013 launched the first continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) project. That project was the first step in Nordstrom's cloud native journey.</p>
-->
<p>公司也渴望加快步伐，并在 2013 年启动了首个持续集成/部署（CI/CD）项目。该项目是 Nordstrom 云原生之旅的第一步。</p>

<!-- 
<p>Dev and Ops team members built a CI/CD pipeline, working with the company's servers on premise. The team chose <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">Chef</a>, and wrote cookbooks that automated virtual IP creation, servers, and load balancing. "After we completed the project, deployment went from three months to 30 minutes," says Patel. "We still had multiple environments—dev, test, staging, then production—so with each environment running the Chef cookbooks, it took 30 minutes. It was a huge achievement at that point."</p>
-->
<p>开发人员和运营团队成员构建了一个 CI/CD 管道，在内部使用公司的服务器。团队选择了 <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">Chef</a>，并编写了自动虚拟 IP 创建、服务器和负载均衡的指导手册。Patel 说：“项目完成后，部署时间从 3 个月减少到 30 分钟。我们仍有开发、测试、暂存、然后生产等多个环境需要重新部署。之后，每个运行 Chef 说明书的环境部署都只花 30 分钟。在那个时候，这是一个巨大的成就。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>But new environments still took too long to turn up, so the next step was working in the cloud. Today, Nordstrom Technology has built an enterprise platform that allows the company's 1,500 developers to deploy applications running as Docker containers in the cloud, orchestrated with Kubernetes.</p> -->
<p>但是，新环境仍然需要很长时间才能出现，因此下一步是在云中工作。如今，Nordstrom  Technology 已经构建了一个企业平台，允许公司的 1500 名开发人员在云中部署以 Docker 容器身份运行的应用程序，这些应用程序由 Kubernetes 进行编排。</p>

<p>"The cloud provided faster access to resources, because it took weeks for us to get a virtual machine (VM) on premises," says Patel. "But now we can do the same thing in only five minutes."</p>
-->
<p>Patel 说：“云提供了对资源的更快访问，因为我们在内部需要花数周时间才能部署一个虚拟机（VM）来提供服务。但现在我们可以做同样的事情，只需五分钟。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>Nordstrom's first foray into scheduling containers on a cluster was a homegrown system based on CoreOS fleet. They began doing a few proofs of concept projects with that system until Kubernetes 1.0 was released when they made the switch. "We made a bet that Kubernetes was going to take off, informed by early indicators of community support and project velocity, so we rebuilt our system with Kubernetes at the core," says Marius Grigoriu, Sr. Manager of the Kubernetes team at Nordstrom.</p>
-->
<p>Nordstrom 首次尝试在集群上调度容器，是基于 CoreOS fleet 的原生系统。他们开始使用该系统做一些概念验证项目，直到 Kubernetes 1.0 发布时才将正式项目迁移到里面。Nordstrom 的 Kubernetes 团队经理 Marius Grigoriu 表示：“了解到早期的社区支持和项目迭代指标，我们肯定 Kubernetes 一定会成功的，因此我们以 Kubernetes 为核心重建了我们的系统。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>While Kubernetes is often thought as a platform for microservices, the first application to launch on Kubernetes in a critical production role at Nordstrom was Jira. "It was not the ideal microservice we were hoping to get as our first application," Patel admits, "but the team that was working on it was really passionate about Docker and Kubernetes, and they wanted to try it out. They had their application running on premises, and wanted to move it to Kubernetes."</p>
-->
<p>虽然 Kubernetes 通常被视为微服务的平台，但在 Nordstrom 担任关键生产角色的 Kubernetes 上推出的第一个应用程序是 Jira。Patel 承认：“这不是我们希望作为第一个应用程序获得的理想微服务，但致力于此应用程序的团队对 Docker 和 Kubernetes 非常热情，他们希望尝试一下。他们的应用程序部署在内部运行，并希望将其移动到 Kubernetes。</p>

<!-- 
<p>The benefits were immediate for the teams that came on board. "Teams running on our Kubernetes cluster loved the fact that they had fewer issues to worry about. They didn't need to manage infrastructure or operating systems," says Grigoriu. "Early adopters loved the declarative nature of Kubernetes. They loved the reduced surface area they had to deal with."</p> -->
<p>对于加入的团队来说，这些好处是立竿见影的。Grigoriu 说：“在我们的 Kubernetes 集群中运行的团队喜欢这样一个事实，即他们担心的问题更少，他们不需要管理基础设施或操作系统。早期使用者喜欢 Kubernetes 的声明特性，让他们不得不处理的面积减少。</p>

<p>To support these early adopters, Patel's team began growing the cluster and building production-grade services. "We integrated with <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> for monitoring, with a <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> front end; we used <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/">Fluentd</a> to push logs to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>, so that gives us log aggregation," says Patel. The team also added dozens of open-source components, including CNCF projects and has made contributions to Kubernetes, Terraform, and kube2iam.</p>
-->
<p>为了支持这些早期使用者，Patel 的团队开始发展集群并构建生产级服务。“我们与 <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> 集成了监控功能，并配有 <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> 前端；我们使用 <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/">Fluentd</a> 将日志推送到 <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a>，从而提供日志聚合”Patel 说。该团队还增加了数十个开源组件，包括 CNCF 项目，而且把这些成果都贡献给了 Kubernetes、Terraform 和 kube2iam。</p>

<!-- 
<p>There are now more than 60 development teams running Kubernetes in Nordstrom Technology, and as success stories have popped up, more teams have gotten on board. "Our initial customer base, the ones who were willing to try this out, are now going and evangelizing to the next set of users," says Patel. "One early adopter had Docker containers and he was not sure how to run it in production. We sat with him and within 15 minutes we deployed it in production. He thought it was amazing, and more people in his org started coming in."</p>
-->
<p>现在有 60 多个开发团队在 Nordstrom 上运行 Kubernetes，随着成功案例的涌现，更多的团队加入进来。Patel 说：“我们最初的客户群，那些愿意尝试这些的客户群，现在已经开始向后续用户宣传。一个早期使用者拥有 Docker 容器，他不知道如何在生产中运行它。我们和他一起协作，在 15 分钟内，我们将其部署到生产中。他认为这是惊人的，他所在的组织更多的人开始加入进来。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>For Nordstrom Technology, going cloud-native has vastly improved development and operational efficiency. The developers using Kubernetes now deploy faster and can focus on building value in their applications.  One such team started with a 25-minute merge to deploy by launching virtual machines in the cloud. Switching to Kubernetes was a 5x speedup in their process, improving their merge to deploy time to 5 minutes.</p>
-->
<p>对于 Nordstrom 而言，云原生极大地提高了开发和运营效率。现在，使用 Kubernetes 的开发人员部署速度更快，可以专注于在其应用程序中构建价值。一个团队从 25 分钟的合并开始，通过在云中启动虚拟机来进行部署。切换到 Kubernetes 的过程速度是原来 5 倍，将合并时间缩短为 5 分钟。</p>

"With Kubernetes, without even trying to make our cluster efficient, we are currently at 40 percent CPU utilization—a 10x increase. we are running 2600+ customer pods that would have been 2600+ VMs if they had gone directly to the cloud. We are running them on 40 VMs now, so that's a huge reduction in operational overhead."

“借助 Kubernetes，我们甚至不需要尝试去提高集群的效率，目前 CPU 利用率为 40%，较之前增长了 10 倍。我们正在运行 2600 多个客户 Pod，如果它们直接进入云，这些 Pod 将是 2600 多个 VM。我们现在在 40 台 VM 上运行它们，因此这大大降低了运营开销。
{{< /case-studies/quote >}}

<!-- 
<p>Speed is great, and easily demonstrated, but perhaps the bigger impact lies in the operational efficiency. "We run thousands of VMs on AWS, and their overall average CPU utilization is about four percent," says Patel. "With Kubernetes, without even trying to make our cluster efficient, we are currently at 40 percent CPU utilization—a 10x increase. We are running 2600+ customer pods that would have been 2600+ VMs if they had gone directly to the cloud. We are running them on 40 VMs now, so that's a huge reduction in operational overhead."</p>
-->
<p>速度很重要，并且很容易证明，但也许更大的影响在于运营效率。Patel 说：“我们在 AWS 上运行了数千个 VM，它们的总体平均 CPU 利用率约为 4%。借助 Kubernetes，我们甚至不需要尝试去提高集群的效率，目前 CPU 利用率为 40%，较之前增长了 10 倍。我们正在运行 2600 多个客户 Pod，如果它们直接上云，这些 Pod 将是 2600 多个 VM。我们现在在 40 台 VM 上运行它们，因此这大大降低了运营开销。</p>

<!-- 
<p>Nordstrom Technology is also exploring running Kubernetes on bare metal on premises. "If we can build an on-premises Kubernetes cluster," says Patel, "we could bring the power of cloud to provision resources fast on-premises. Then for the developer, their interface is Kubernetes; they might not even realize or care that their services are now deployed on premises because they're only working with Kubernetes."</p>
-->
<p>Patel 说：“如果我们能构建一个本地 Kubernetes 集群，我们就能将云的力量带到本地快速调配资源。之后对于开发人员来说，他们面向的接口是 Kubernetes；他们甚至可能没有意识到或不关心他们的服务现在部署在内部，因为他们只与 Kubernetes 一起工作。</p>

<!-- 
<p>For that reason, Patel is eagerly following Kubernetes' development of multi-cluster capabilities. "With cluster federation, we can have our on-premise as the primary cluster and the cloud as a secondary burstable cluster," he says. "So, when there is an anniversary sale or Black Friday sale, and we need more containers - we can go to the cloud."</p>
-->
<p>因此，Patel 热切关注 Kubernetes 多集群能力的发展。他说：“有了集群联合，我们可以将内部部署作为主集群，将云作为辅助可突发集群。因此，当有周年销售或黑色星期五销售并且我们需要更多的容器时，我们可以上云。”</p>

<!-- 
<p>That kind of possibility—as well as the impact that Grigoriu and Patel's team has already delivered using Kubernetes—is what led Nordstrom on its cloud native journey in the first place. "The way the retail environment is today, we are trying to build responsiveness and flexibility where we can," says Grigoriu.  "Kubernetes makes it easy to: bring efficiency to both the Dev and Ops side of the equation. It's a win-win."</p>
-->
<p>这种可能性以及 Grigoriu 和 Patel 的团队已经使用Kubernetes所提供的影响，是 Nordstrom 最初在云原生之旅中所起的作用。Grigoriu 说：“在当下的零售模式下，我们正在努力在力所能及的地方建立响应能力和灵活性。Kubernetes 使得为开发端和运维端同时带来效率的提升，这是一个双赢。”</p>
