<!--
You need to have shell access to all the nodes, and the kubectl command-line tool must
be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial 
on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.

你必须有 Shell 能访问所有节点，且必须配置 kubectl 命令行工具让其与你的集群通信。
建议运行本教程的集群至少有两个节点，且这两个节点不能作为控制平面主机。
