Good day, everyone 👋

大家好 👋

<!--
Welcome to the first episode of the APAC edition of the "Meet Our Contributors" blog post series.
-->
欢迎来到亚太地区的“认识我们的贡献者”博文系列第一期。


<!--
In this post, we'll introduce you to five amazing folks from the India region who have been actively contributing to the upstream Kubernetes projects in a variety of ways, as well as being the leaders or maintainers of numerous community initiatives.
-->
在这篇文章中，我们将向您介绍来自印度地区的五位优秀贡献者，他们一直在以各种方式积极地为上游 Kubernetes 项目做贡献，同时也是众多社区倡议的领导者和维护者。

<!--
💫 *Let's get started, so without further ado…* 
-->
💫 *闲话少说，我们开始吧。*


## [Arsh Sharma](https://github.com/RinkiyaKeDad)

<!--
Arsh is currently employed with Okteto as a Developer Experience engineer. As a new contributor, he realised that 1:1 mentorship opportunities were quite beneficial in getting him started with the upstream project.
-->
Arsh 目前在 Okteto 公司中担任开发者体验工程师职务。作为一名新的贡献者，他意识到一对一的指导机会让他在开始上游项目中受益匪浅。

<!--
He is presently a CI Signal shadow on the Kubernetes 1.23 release team. He is also contributing to the SIG Testing and SIG Docs projects, as well as to the [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/infrastructure) tools development work that is being done under the aegis of SIG Architecture.
-->
他目前是 Kubernetes 1.23 版本团队的 CI Signal 经理。他还致力于为 SIG Testing 和 SIG Docs 项目提供贡献，并且在 SIG Architecture 项目中负责 [证书管理器](https://github.com/cert-manager/infrastructure) 工具的开发工作。

<!--
To the newcomers, Arsh helps plan their early contributions sustainably.
-->
对于新人来说，Arsh 帮助他们可持续地计划早期贡献。

<!--
> _I would encourage folks to contribute in a way that's sustainable. What I mean by that
> is that it's easy to be very enthusiastic early on and take up more stuff than one can
> actually handle. This can often lead to burnout in later stages. It's much more sustainable
> to work on things iteratively._
-->
> _我鼓励大家以可持续的方式为社区做贡献。我的意思是，一个人很容易在早期的时候非常有热情，并且承担了很多超出个人实际能力的事情。这通常会导致后期的倦怠。迭代地处理事情会让大家对社区的贡献变得可持续。_

## [Kunal Kushwaha](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha)

> _I believe if you find yourself in a place where you do not know much about the
> project, that's a good thing because now you can learn while contributing and the
> community is there to help you. It has helped me a lot in gaining skills, meeting
> people from around the world and also helping them. You can learn on the go,
> you don't have to be an expert. Make sure to also check out no code contributions
> because being a beginner is a skill and you can bring new perspectives to the
> organisation._
-->
> _我相信，如果你发现自己在一个了解不多的项目当中，那是件好事，因为现在你可以一边贡献一边学习，社区也会帮助你。它帮助我获得了很多技能，认识了来自世界各地的人，也帮助了他们。你可以在这个过程中学习，自己不一定必须是专家。请重视非代码贡献，因为作为初学者这是一项技能，你可以为组织带来新的视角。_

<!--
Among several significant contributions are his recent efforts toward the Archival of [design proposals](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6055), refactoring the ["groups" codebase](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/2713) under k8s-infra repository to make it mockable and testable, and improving the functionality of the [GitHub k8s bot](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/23129).
-->
在这几个重要项目中，他最近致力于 [设计方案](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6055) 的存档工作，重构 k8s-infra 存储库下的 ["组"代码库](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/2713) ，使其具有可模拟性和可测试性，以及改进 [GitHub k8s 机器人](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/23129) 的功能。

<!--
In addition to his technical efforts, Madhav oversees many projects aimed at assisting new contributors. He organises bi-weekly "KEP reading club" sessions to help newcomers understand the process of adding new features, deprecating old ones, and making other key changes to the upstream project. He has also worked on developing [Katacoda scenarios](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-katacoda) to assist new contributors to become acquainted with the process of contributing to k/k. In addition to his current efforts to meet with community members every week, he has organised several [new contributors workshops (NCW)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgsXbHBRYIc).
-->
除了在技术方面的贡献，Madhav 还监督许多旨在帮助新贡献者的项目。他每两周组织一次的“KEP 阅读俱乐部”会议，帮助新人了解添加新功能、摒弃旧功能以及对上游项目进行其他关键更改的过程。他还致力于开发 [Katacoda 场景](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-katacoda) ，以帮助新的贡献者在为 k/k 做贡献的过程更加熟练。目前除了每周与社区成员会面外，他还组织了几个 [新贡献者讲习班（NCW）](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgsXbHBRYIc) 。

<!--
> _I initially did not know much about Kubernetes. I joined because the community was
> super friendly. But what made me stay was not just the people, but the project itself.
> My solution to not feeling overwhelmed in the community was to gain as much context
> and knowledge into the topics that I was interested in and were being discussed. And
> as a result I continued to dig deeper into Kubernetes and the design of it.
> I am a systems nut & thus Kubernetes was an absolute goldmine for me._
-->
> _一开始我对 Kubernetes 了解并不多。我加入社区是因为社区超级友好。但让我留下来的不仅仅是人，还有项目本身。我在社区中不会感到不知所措，这是因为我能够在感兴趣的和正在讨论的主题中获得尽可能多的背景和知识。因此，我将继续深入探讨 Kubernetes 及其设计。我是一个系统迷，kubernetes 对我来说绝对是一个金矿。_


## [Rajas Kakodkar](https://github.com/rajaskakodkar)

He is now a key contributor to the Testing special interest group. He is also active in the SIG Network community. Lately, Rajas has contributed significantly to the [NetworkPolicy++](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtWQy2fNa4qXRag9cCp5_HsefD7bxKe3ea2RPn8jnSs/) and [`kpng`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kpng) sub-projects.

<!--
One of the first challenges he ran across was that he was in a different time zone than the upstream project's regular meeting hours. However, async interactions on community forums progressively corrected that problem.
-->
他遇到的第一个挑战是，他所处的时区与上游项目的日常会议时间不同。不过，社区论坛上的异步交互逐渐解决了这个问题。

<!--
> _I enjoy contributing to Kubernetes not just because I get to work on
> cutting edge tech but more importantly because I get to work with
> awesome people and help in solving real world problems._
-->
> _我喜欢为 kubernetes 做出贡献，不仅因为我可以从事尖端技术工作，更重要的是，我可以和优秀的人一起工作，并帮助解决现实问题。_

<!--
According to Rajula, attending project meetings and shadowing various project roles are vital for learning about the community.
-->

<!--
> _I find the community very helpful and it's always_
> “you get back as much as you contribute”.
> _The more involved you are, the more you will understand, get to learn and
> contribute new things._
> 
> _The first step to_ “come forward and start” _is hard. But it's all gonna be
> smooth after that. Just take that jump._
-->
> _我发现社区非常有帮助，而且总是“你得到的回报和你贡献的一样多”。你参与得越多，你就越会了解、学习和贡献新东西。_
