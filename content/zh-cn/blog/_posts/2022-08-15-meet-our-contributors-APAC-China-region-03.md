Hello, everyone 👋

Welcome back to the third edition of the "Meet Our Contributors" blog post series for APAC.

This post features four outstanding contributors from China, who have played diverse leadership and community roles in the upstream Kubernetes project.

So, without further ado, let's get straight to the article.
-->
大家好 👋

欢迎来到亚太地区的 “认识我们的贡献者” 博文系列第三期。

这篇博文介绍了四名来自中国的优秀贡献者，他们在上游 Kubernetes 项目中扮演了不同的领导角色和社区角色。

闲话少说，让我们直接进入正文。

## [Andy Zhang](https://github.com/andyzhangx)

<!--
Andy Zhang currently works for Microsoft China at the Shanghai site. His main focus is on Kubernetes storage drivers. Andy started contributing to Kubernetes about 5 years ago.

He states that as he is working in Azure Kubernetes Service team and spends most of his time contributing to the Kubernetes community project. Now he is the main contributor of quite a lot Kubernetes subprojects such as Kubernetes cloud provider code.
-->
Andy Zhang 目前就职于微软中国上海办事处，他主要关注 Kubernetes 存储驱动。
Andy 大约在 5 年前开始为 Kubernetes 做贡献。

他说由于自己为 Azure Kubernetes Service 团队工作，所以大部分时间都在为 Kubernetes 社区项目做贡献。
现在他是很多 Kubernetes 子项目的主要贡献者，例如 Kubernetes cloud-provider 仓库的代码。

<!--
His open source contributions are mainly self-motivated. In the last two years he has mentored a few students contributing to Kubernetes through the LFX Mentorship program, some of whom got jobs due to their expertise and contributions on Kubernetes projects.

Andy is an active member of the China Kubernetes community. He adds that the Kubernetes community has a good guide about how to become members, code reviewers, approvers and finally when he found out that some open source projects are in the very early stage, he actively contributed to those projects and became the project maintainer.
-->
他的开源贡献主要是出于自我激励。在过去的两年里，他通过 LFX Mentorship 计划指导了一些学生为 Kubernetes 做贡献，
其中一些学生凭借 Kubernetes 项目积累的专业知识和贡献经历而找到了工作。

Andy 是 Kubernetes 中国社区的活跃成员。
他补充说，Kubernetes 社区对如何成为 Member、Code Reviewer、Approver 有完善的指导说明，
后来他发现一些开源项目还处于非常早期的阶段，他积极地为这些项目做了贡献并成为了项目维护者。

## [Shiming Zhang](https://github.com/wzshiming)

<!--
Shiming Zhang is a Software Engineer working on Kubernetes for DaoCloud in Shanghai, China.

He has mostly been involved with SIG Node as a reviewer. His major contributions have mainly been bug fixes and feature improvements in an ongoing [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2712-pod-priority-based-graceful-node-shutdown), all revolving around SIG Node.

Some of his major PRs are [fixing watchForLockfileContention memory leak](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100326), [fixing startupProbe behaviour](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101093), [adding Field status.hostIPs for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2661).
-->
Shiming Zhang 是一名软件工程师，供职于中国上海道客网络科技。

他主要以 Reviewer 的身份参与 SIG Node。他的主要贡献集中在当下的
[KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2712-pod-priority-based-graceful-node-shutdown)
的漏洞修复和功能优化，这些工作全部围绕 SIG Node 展开。

他发起的一些主要 PR 有
[fixing watchForLockfileContention memory leak](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/100326)、
[fixing startupProbe behaviour](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101093)、
[adding Field status.hostIPs for Pod](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2661)。

## [Paco Xu](https://github.com/pacoxu)

<!--
Paco Xu works at DaoCloud, a Shanghai-based cloud-native firm. He works with the infra and the open source team, focusing on enterprise cloud native platforms based on Kubernetes.

He started with Kubernetes in early 2017 and his first contribution was in March 2018. He started with a bug that he found, but his solution was not that graceful, hence wasn't accepted. He then started with some good first issues, which helped him to a great extent. In addition to this, from 2016 to 2017, he made some minor contributions to Docker.
-->
Paco Xu 就职于上海的一家云原生公司：道客网络科技。
他与基础设施和开源团队合作，专注于基于 Kubernetes 的企业云原生平台。

他在 2017 年初开始使用 Kubernetes，他的第一个贡献是在 2018 年 3 月。
他的贡献始于自己发现的一个漏洞，但当时他的解决方案不是那么优雅，因此没有被接受。
然后他从一些 Good First Issue 开始做贡献，这在很大程度上帮助了他。
除此之外，在 2016 到 2017 年间，他还对 Docker 做出了一些小贡献。

<!--
Currently, Paco is a reviewer for `kubeadm` (a SIG Cluster Lifecycle product), and for SIG Node.

Paco says that you should contribute to open source projects you use. For him, an open source project is like a book to learn, getting inspired through discussions with the project maintainers.

> In my opinion, the best way for me is learning how owners work on the project.
-->
目前，Paco 是 `kubeadm`（一个 SIG Cluster Lifecycle 产品）和 SIG Node 的 Reviewer。

Paco 说大家应该为自己使用的开源项目做贡献。
对他来说，开源项目就像一本要学习的书，通过与项目维护者们讨论可以获得启发。

> 在我看来，对我来说最好的方式是学习项目所有者如何处理项目。

## [Jintao Zhang](https://github.com/tao12345666333)

<!--
Jintao Zhang is presently employed at API7, where he focuses on ingress and service mesh.

In 2017, he encountered an issue which led to a community discussion and his contributions to Kubernetes started. Before contributing to Kubernetes, Jintao was a long-time contributor to Docker-related open source projects.
-->
Jintao Zhang 目前受聘于 API7，他专注于 Ingress 和服务网格。

2017 年，他遇到了一个引发社区讨论的问题，并开始了对 Kubernetes 做贡献。
在为 Kubernetes 做贡献之前，Jintao 是 Docker 相关开源项目的长期贡献者。

<!--
Currently Jintao is a maintainer for the [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) project.

He suggests keeping track of job opportunities at open source companies so that you can find one that allows you to contribute full time. For new contributors Jintao says that if anyone wants to make a significant contribution to an open source project, then they should choose the project based on their interests and should generously invest time.
-->
目前 Jintao 是 [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) 项目的 Maintainer。

他建议关注开源公司的工作机会，这样你就可以找到一个可以让你全职贡献的机会。
对于新的贡献者们，Jintao 表示如果有人想为一个开源项目做重大贡献，
那么应该根据自己的兴趣选择项目，然后应该慷慨地投入时间。
