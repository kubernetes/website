`Federation V1`, the current Kubernetes federation API which reuses the Kubernetes API resources 'as is', is currently considered alpha for many of its features. There is no clear path to evolve the API to GA; however, there is a `Federation V2` effort in progress to implement a dedicated federation API apart from the Kubernetes API. The details are available at [sig-multicluster community page](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-multicluster).
