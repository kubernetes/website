This guide assumes that you have a running Kubernetes Cluster Federation installation. 
If not, then head over to the [federation admin guide](/docs/tutorials/federation/set-up-cluster-federation-kubefed/) to learn how to
bring up a cluster federation (or have your cluster administrator do this for you).
Other tutorials, such as Kelsey Hightower's [Federated Kubernetes Tutorial](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-cluster-federation),
might also help you create a Federated Kubernetes cluster.
