[Kubernetes]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/overview/" >}}), also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
