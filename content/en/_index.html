[Kubernetes]({{< relref "/docs/concepts/overview/" >}}), also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon [15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444), combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
