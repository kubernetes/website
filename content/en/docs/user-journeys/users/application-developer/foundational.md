## Why Kubernetes?

Users expect web applications to be available 24/7, and developers expect to deploy new versions of applications several times a day. Kubernetes helps deploy software to serve these goals:

  - Ensure that applications run where and when you want
  - Ensure applications have all the required resources and tools to run
