<!-- overview -->
This page provides an overview of Admission Controllers.


<!-- body -->
## What are they?

An _admission controller_ is a piece of code that intercepts requests to the
Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the object, but after the request
is authenticated and authorized.

Admission controllers may be _validating_, _mutating_, or both. Mutating
controllers may modify related objects to the requests they admit; validating controllers may not.

Admission controllers limit requests to create, delete, modify objects. Admission
controllers can also block custom verbs, such as a request connect to a Pod via
an API server proxy. Admission controllers do _not_ (and cannot) block requests
to read (**get**, **watch** or **list**) objects.

The admission controllers in Kubernetes {{< skew currentVersion >}} consist of the
[list](#what-does-each-admission-controller-do) below, are compiled into the
`kube-apiserver` binary, and may only be configured by the cluster
administrator. In that list, there are two special controllers:
MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.  These execute the
mutating and validating (respectively)
[admission control webhooks](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#admission-webhooks)
which are configured in the API.

## Admission control phases

The admission control process proceeds in two phases. In the first phase,
mutating admission controllers are run. In the second phase, validating
admission controllers are run. Note again that some of the controllers are
both.

If any of the controllers in either phase reject the request, the entire
request is rejected immediately and an error is returned to the end-user.

Finally, in addition to sometimes mutating the object in question, admission
controllers may sometimes have side effects, that is, mutate related
resources as part of request processing. Incrementing quota usage is the
canonical example of why this is necessary. Any such side-effect needs a
corresponding reclamation or reconciliation process, as a given admission
controller does not know for sure that a given request will pass all of the
other admission controllers.

## Why do I need them?

Several important features of Kubernetes require an admission controller to be enabled in order
to properly support the feature.  As a result, a Kubernetes API server that is not properly
configured with the right set of admission controllers is an incomplete server and will not
support all the features you expect.

## How do I turn on an admission controller?

The Kubernetes API server flag `enable-admission-plugins` takes a comma-delimited list of admission control plugins to invoke prior to modifying objects in the cluster.
For example, the following command line enables the `NamespaceLifecycle` and the `LimitRanger`
admission control plugins:

```shell
kube-apiserver --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger ...
```

{{< note >}}
Depending on the way your Kubernetes cluster is deployed and how the API server is
started, you may need to apply the settings in different ways. For example, you may
have to modify the systemd unit file if the API server is deployed as a systemd
service, you may modify the manifest file for the API server if Kubernetes is deployed
in a self-hosted way.
{{< /note >}}

## How do I turn off an admission controller?

The Kubernetes API server flag `disable-admission-plugins` takes a comma-delimited list of admission control plugins to be disabled, even if they are in the list of plugins enabled by default.

```shell
kube-apiserver --disable-admission-plugins=PodNodeSelector,AlwaysDeny ...
```

## Which plugins are enabled by default?

To see which admission plugins are enabled:

```shell
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
```

In Kubernetes {{< skew currentVersion >}}, the default ones are:

```shell
CertificateApproval, CertificateSigning, CertificateSubjectRestriction, DefaultIngressClass, DefaultStorageClass, DefaultTolerationSeconds, LimitRanger, MutatingAdmissionWebhook, NamespaceLifecycle, PersistentVolumeClaimResize, PodSecurity, Priority, ResourceQuota, RuntimeClass, ServiceAccount, StorageObjectInUseProtection, TaintNodesByCondition, ValidatingAdmissionPolicy, ValidatingAdmissionWebhook
```

{{< note >}}
The [`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`](#validatingadmissionpolicy) admission plugin is enabled
by default, but is only active if you enable the `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) **and**
the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API.
{{< /note >}}

## What does each admission controller do?

### AlwaysAdmit {#alwaysadmit}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.13" state="deprecated" >}}

This admission controller allows all pods into the cluster. It is **deprecated** because
its behavior is the same as if there were no admission controller at all.

### AlwaysDeny {#alwaysdeny}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.13" state="deprecated" >}}

Rejects all requests. AlwaysDeny is **deprecated** as it has no real meaning.

### AlwaysPullImages {#alwayspullimages}

This admission controller modifies every new Pod to force the image pull policy to `Always`. This is useful in a
multitenant cluster so that users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those
who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission controller, once an image has been pulled to a
node, any pod from any user can use it by knowing the image's name (assuming the Pod is
scheduled onto the right node), without any authorization check against the image. When this admission controller
is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are
required.

### CertificateApproval {#certificateapproval}

This admission controller observes requests to approve CertificateSigningRequest resources and performs additional
authorization checks to ensure the approving user has permission to **approve** certificate requests with the
`spec.signerName` requested on the CertificateSigningRequest resource.

See [Certificate Signing Requests](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) for more
information on the permissions required to perform different actions on CertificateSigningRequest resources.

### CertificateSigning {#certificatesigning}

This admission controller observes updates to the `status.certificate` field of CertificateSigningRequest resources
and performs an additional authorization checks to ensure the signing user has permission to **sign** certificate
requests with the `spec.signerName` requested on the CertificateSigningRequest resource.

See [Certificate Signing Requests](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) for more
information on the permissions required to perform different actions on CertificateSigningRequest resources.

### CertificateSubjectRestriction {#certificatesubjectrestriction}

This admission controller observes creation of CertificateSigningRequest resources that have a `spec.signerName`
of `kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client`. It rejects any request that specifies a 'group' (or 'organization attribute')
of `system:masters`.

### DefaultIngressClass {#defaultingressclass}

This admission controller observes creation of `Ingress` objects that do not request any specific
ingress class and automatically adds a default ingress class to them.  This way, users that do not
request any special ingress class do not need to care about them at all and they will get the
default one.

This admission controller does not do anything when no default ingress class is configured. When more than one ingress
class is marked as default, it rejects any creation of `Ingress` with an error and an administrator
must revisit their `IngressClass` objects and mark only one as default (with the annotation
"ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class").  This admission controller ignores any `Ingress`
updates; it acts only on creation.

See the [Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) documentation for more about ingress
classes and how to mark one as default.

### DefaultStorageClass {#defaultstorageclass}

This admission controller observes creation of `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects that do not request any specific storage class
and automatically adds a default storage class to them.
This way, users that do not request any special storage class do not need to care about them at all and they
will get the default one.

This admission controller does not do anything when no default storage class is configured. When more than one storage
class is marked as default, it rejects any creation of `PersistentVolumeClaim` with an error and an administrator
must revisit their `StorageClass` objects and mark only one as default.
This admission controller ignores any `PersistentVolumeClaim` updates; it acts only on creation.

See [persistent volume](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) documentation about persistent volume claims and
storage classes and how to mark a storage class as default.

### DefaultTolerationSeconds {#defaulttolerationseconds}

This admission controller sets the default forgiveness toleration for pods to tolerate
the taints `notready:NoExecute` and `unreachable:NoExecute` based on the k8s-apiserver input parameters
`default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` if the pods don't already
have toleration for taints `node.kubernetes.io/not-ready:NoExecute` or
`node.kubernetes.io/unreachable:NoExecute`.
The default value for `default-not-ready-toleration-seconds` and `default-unreachable-toleration-seconds` is 5 minutes.

### DenyServiceExternalIPs

This admission controller rejects all net-new usage of the `Service` field `externalIPs`.  This
feature is very powerful (allows network traffic interception) and not well
controlled by policy.  When enabled, users of the cluster may not create new
Services which use `externalIPs` and may not add new values to `externalIPs` on
existing `Service` objects.  Existing uses of `externalIPs` are not affected,
and users may remove values from `externalIPs` on existing `Service` objects.

Most users do not need this feature at all, and cluster admins should consider disabling it.
Clusters that do need to use this feature should consider using some custom policy to manage usage
of it.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### EventRateLimit {#eventratelimit}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.13" state="alpha" >}}

This admission controller mitigates the problem where the API server gets flooded by
requests to store new Events. The cluster admin can specify event rate limits by:

* Enabling the `EventRateLimit` admission controller;
* Referencing an `EventRateLimit` configuration file from the file provided to the API
  server's command line flag `--admission-control-config-file`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: EventRateLimit
    path: eventconfig.yaml
...
```

There are four types of limits that can be specified in the configuration:

 * `Server`: All Event requests (creation or modifications) received by the API server share a single bucket.
 * `Namespace`: Each namespace has a dedicated bucket.
 * `User`: Each user is allocated a bucket.
 * `SourceAndObject`: A bucket is assigned by each combination of source and
   involved object of the event.

Below is a sample `eventconfig.yaml` for such a configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: eventratelimit.admission.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
limits:
  - type: Namespace
    qps: 50
    burst: 100
    cacheSize: 2000
  - type: User
    qps: 10
    burst: 50
```

See the [EventRateLimit Config API (v1alpha1)](/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-eventratelimit.v1alpha1/)
for more details.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### ExtendedResourceToleration {#extendedresourcetoleration}

This plug-in facilitates creation of dedicated nodes with extended resources.
If operators want to create dedicated nodes with extended resources (like GPUs, FPGAs etc.), they are expected to
[taint the node](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/#example-use-cases) with the extended resource
name as the key. This admission controller, if enabled, automatically
adds tolerations for such taints to pods requesting extended resources, so users don't have to manually
add these tolerations.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### ImagePolicyWebhook {#imagepolicywebhook}

The ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller allows a backend webhook to make admission decisions.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

#### Configuration file format {#imagereview-config-file-format}

ImagePolicyWebhook uses a configuration file to set options for the behavior of the backend.
This file may be json or yaml and has the following format:

```yaml
imagePolicy:
  kubeConfigFile: /path/to/kubeconfig/for/backend
  # time in s to cache approval
  allowTTL: 50
  # time in s to cache denial
  denyTTL: 50
  # time in ms to wait between retries
  retryBackoff: 500
  # determines behavior if the webhook backend fails
  defaultAllow: true
```

Reference the ImagePolicyWebhook configuration file from the file provided to the API server's command line flag `--admission-control-config-file`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: ImagePolicyWebhook
    path: imagepolicyconfig.yaml
...
```

Alternatively, you can embed the configuration directly in the file:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
  - name: ImagePolicyWebhook
    configuration:
      imagePolicy:
        kubeConfigFile: <path-to-kubeconfig-file>
        allowTTL: 50
        denyTTL: 50
        retryBackoff: 500
        defaultAllow: true
```

The ImagePolicyWebhook config file must reference a
[kubeconfig](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
formatted file which sets up the connection to the backend.
It is required that the backend communicate over TLS.

The kubeconfig file's `cluster` field must point to the remote service, and the `user` field
must contain the returned authorizer.

```yaml
# clusters refers to the remote service.
clusters:
  - name: name-of-remote-imagepolicy-service
    cluster:
      certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.pem    # CA for verifying the remote service.
      server: https://images.example.com/policy # URL of remote service to query. Must use 'https'.

# users refers to the API server's webhook configuration.
users:
  - name: name-of-api-server
    user:
      client-certificate: /path/to/cert.pem # cert for the webhook admission controller to use
      client-key: /path/to/key.pem          # key matching the cert
```

For additional HTTP configuration, refer to the
[kubeconfig](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) documentation.

#### Request payloads

When faced with an admission decision, the API Server POSTs a JSON serialized
`imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1` `ImageReview` object describing the action.
This object contains fields describing the containers being admitted, as well as
any pod annotations that match `*.image-policy.k8s.io/*`.

{{< note >}}
The webhook API objects are subject to the same versioning compatibility rules
as other Kubernetes API objects. Implementers should be aware of looser compatibility
promises for alpha objects and check the `apiVersion` field of the request to
ensure correct deserialization.
Additionally, the API Server must enable the `imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1` API extensions
group (`--runtime-config=imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1=true`).
{{< /note >}}

An example request body:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "ImageReview",
  "spec": {
    "containers": [
      {
        "image": "myrepo/myimage:v1"
      },
      {
        "image": "myrepo/myimage@sha256:beb6bd6a68f114c1dc2ea4b28db81bdf91de202a9014972bec5e4d9171d90ed"
      }
    ],
    "annotations": {
      "mycluster.image-policy.k8s.io/ticket-1234": "break-glass"
    },
    "namespace": "mynamespace"
  }
}
```

The remote service is expected to fill the `status` field of the request and
respond to either allow or disallow access. The response body's `spec` field is ignored, and
may be omitted. A permissive response would return:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "ImageReview",
  "status": {
    "allowed": true
  }
}
```

To disallow access, the service would return:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "imagepolicy.k8s.io/v1alpha1",
  "kind": "ImageReview",
  "status": {
    "allowed": false,
    "reason": "image currently blacklisted"
  }
}
```

For further documentation refer to the
[`imagepolicy.v1alpha1` API](/docs/reference/config-api/imagepolicy.v1alpha1/).

#### Extending with Annotations

All annotations on a Pod that match `*.image-policy.k8s.io/*` are sent to the webhook.
Sending annotations allows users who are aware of the image policy backend to
send extra information to it, and for different backends implementations to
accept different information.

Examples of information you might put here are:

* request to "break glass" to override a policy, in case of emergency.
* a ticket number from a ticket system that documents the break-glass request
* provide a hint to the policy server as to the imageID of the image being provided, to save it a lookup

In any case, the annotations are provided by the user and are not validated by Kubernetes in any way.

### LimitPodHardAntiAffinityTopology {#limitpodhardantiaffinitytopology}

This admission controller denies any pod that defines `AntiAffinity` topology key other than
`kubernetes.io/hostname` in `requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution`.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### LimitRanger {#limitranger}

This admission controller will observe the incoming request and ensure that it does not violate
any of the constraints enumerated in the `LimitRange` object in a `Namespace`.  If you are using
`LimitRange` objects in your Kubernetes deployment, you MUST use this admission controller to
enforce those constraints. LimitRanger can also be used to apply default resource requests to Pods
that don't specify any; currently, the default LimitRanger applies a 0.1 CPU requirement to all
Pods in the `default` namespace.

See the [LimitRange API reference](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/policy-resources/limit-range-v1/)
and the [example of LimitRange](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/)
for more details.

### MutatingAdmissionWebhook {#mutatingadmissionwebhook}

This admission controller calls any mutating webhooks which match the request. Matching
webhooks are called in serial; each one may modify the object if it desires.

This admission controller (as implied by the name) only runs in the mutating phase.

If a webhook called by this has side effects (for example, decrementing quota) it
*must* have a reconciliation system, as it is not guaranteed that subsequent
webhooks or validating admission controllers will permit the request to finish.

If you disable the MutatingAdmissionWebhook, you must also disable the
`MutatingWebhookConfiguration` object in the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`
group/version via the `--runtime-config` flag, both are on by default.

#### Use caution when authoring and installing mutating webhooks

* Users may be confused when the objects they try to create are different from
  what they get back.
* Built in control loops may break when the objects they try to create are
  different when read back.
  * Setting originally unset fields is less likely to cause problems than
    overwriting fields set in the original request. Avoid doing the latter.
* Future changes to control loops for built-in resources or third-party resources
  may break webhooks that work well today. Even when the webhook installation API
  is finalized, not all possible webhook behaviors will be guaranteed to be supported
  indefinitely.

### NamespaceAutoProvision {#namespaceautoprovision}

This admission controller examines all incoming requests on namespaced resources and checks
if the referenced namespace does exist.
It creates a namespace if it cannot be found.
This admission controller is useful in deployments that do not want to restrict creation of
a namespace prior to its usage.

### NamespaceExists {#namespaceexists}

This admission controller checks all requests on namespaced resources other than `Namespace` itself.
If the namespace referenced from a request doesn't exist, the request is rejected.

### NamespaceLifecycle {#namespacelifecycle}

This admission controller enforces that a `Namespace` that is undergoing termination cannot have
new objects created in it, and ensures that requests in a non-existent `Namespace` are rejected.
This admission controller also prevents deletion of three system reserved namespaces `default`,
`kube-system`, `kube-public`.

A `Namespace` deletion kicks off a sequence of operations that remove all objects (pods, services,
etc.) in that namespace.  In order to enforce integrity of that process, we strongly recommend
running this admission controller.

### NodeRestriction {#noderestriction}

This admission controller limits the `Node` and `Pod` objects a kubelet can modify. In order to be limited by this admission controller,
kubelets must use credentials in the `system:nodes` group, with a username in the form `system:node:<nodeName>`.
Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.
kubelets are not allowed to update or remove taints from their `Node` API object.

The `NodeRestriction` admission plugin prevents kubelets from deleting their `Node` API object,
and enforces kubelet modification of labels under the `kubernetes.io/` or `k8s.io/` prefixes as follows:

* **Prevents** kubelets from adding/removing/updating labels with a `node-restriction.kubernetes.io/` prefix.
  This label prefix is reserved for administrators to label their `Node` objects for workload isolation purposes,
  and kubelets will not be allowed to modify labels with that prefix.
* **Allows** kubelets to add/remove/update these labels and label prefixes:
  * `kubernetes.io/hostname`
  * `kubernetes.io/arch`
  * `kubernetes.io/os`
  * `beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type`
  * `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type`
  * `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region` (deprecated)
  * `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` (deprecated)
  * `topology.kubernetes.io/region`
  * `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
  * `kubelet.kubernetes.io/`-prefixed labels
  * `node.kubernetes.io/`-prefixed labels

Use of any other labels under the `kubernetes.io` or `k8s.io` prefixes by kubelets is reserved,
and may be disallowed or allowed by the `NodeRestriction` admission plugin in the future.

Future versions may add additional restrictions to ensure kubelets have the minimal set of
permissions required to operate correctly.

### OwnerReferencesPermissionEnforcement {#ownerreferencespermissionenforcement}

This admission controller protects the access to the `metadata.ownerReferences` of an object
so that only users with **delete** permission to the object can change it.
This admission controller also protects the access to `metadata.ownerReferences[x].blockOwnerDeletion`
of an object, so that only users with **update** permission to the `finalizers`
subresource of the referenced *owner* can change it.

### PersistentVolumeClaimResize {#persistentvolumeclaimresize}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

This admission controller implements additional validations for checking incoming
`PersistentVolumeClaim` resize requests.

Enabling the `PersistentVolumeClaimResize` admission controller is recommended.
This admission controller prevents resizing of all claims by default unless a claim's `StorageClass`
 explicitly enables resizing by setting `allowVolumeExpansion` to `true`.

For example: all `PersistentVolumeClaim`s created from the following `StorageClass` support volume expansion:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gluster-vol-default
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:
  resturl: "http://192.168.10.100:8080"
  restuser: ""
  secretNamespace: ""
  secretName: ""
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

For more information about persistent volume claims, see [PersistentVolumeClaims](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims).

### PersistentVolumeLabel {#persistentvolumelabel}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.13" state="deprecated" >}}

This admission controller automatically attaches region or zone labels to PersistentVolumes
as defined by the cloud provider (for example, Azure or GCP).
It helps ensure the Pods and the PersistentVolumes mounted are in the same
region and/or zone.
If the admission controller doesn't support automatic labelling your PersistentVolumes, you
may need to add the labels manually to prevent pods from mounting volumes from
a different zone. PersistentVolumeLabel is **deprecated** as labeling for persistent volumes has been taken over by
the {{< glossary_tooltip text="cloud-controller-manager" term_id="cloud-controller-manager" >}}.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### PodNodeSelector {#podnodeselector}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.5" state="alpha" >}}

This admission controller defaults and limits what node selectors may be used within a namespace
by reading a namespace annotation and a global configuration.

This admission controller is disabled by default.

#### Configuration file format

`PodNodeSelector` uses a configuration file to set options for the behavior of the backend.
Note that the configuration file format will move to a versioned file in a future release.
This file may be json or yaml and has the following format:

```yaml
podNodeSelectorPluginConfig:
  clusterDefaultNodeSelector: name-of-node-selector
  namespace1: name-of-node-selector
  namespace2: name-of-node-selector
```

Reference the `PodNodeSelector` configuration file from the file provided to the API server's
command line flag `--admission-control-config-file`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
- name: PodNodeSelector
  path: podnodeselector.yaml
...
```

#### Configuration Annotation Format

`PodNodeSelector` uses the annotation key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector` to assign
node selectors to namespaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  annotations:
    scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector: name-of-node-selector
  name: namespace3
```

#### Internal Behavior

This admission controller has the following behavior:

1. If the `Namespace` has an annotation with a key `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/node-selector`,
   use its value as the node selector.
2. If the namespace lacks such an annotation, use the `clusterDefaultNodeSelector` defined in the
   `PodNodeSelector` plugin configuration file as the node selector.
3. Evaluate the pod's node selector against the namespace node selector for conflicts. Conflicts
   result in rejection.
4. Evaluate the pod's node selector against the namespace-specific allowed selector defined the
   plugin configuration file. Conflicts result in rejection.

{{< note >}}
PodNodeSelector allows forcing pods to run on specifically labeled nodes. Also see the PodTolerationRestriction
admission plugin, which allows preventing pods from running on specifically tainted nodes.
{{< /note >}}

### PodSecurity {#podsecurity}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.25" state="stable" >}}

The PodSecurity admission controller checks new Pods before they are
admitted, determines if it should be admitted based on the requested security context and the restrictions on permitted
[Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
for the namespace that the Pod would be in.

See the [Pod Security Admission](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)
documentation for more information.

PodSecurity replaced an older admission controller named PodSecurityPolicy.

### PodTolerationRestriction {#podtolerationrestriction}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.7" state="alpha" >}}

The PodTolerationRestriction admission controller verifies any conflict between tolerations of a
pod and the tolerations of its namespace.
It rejects the pod request if there is a conflict.
It then merges the tolerations annotated on the namespace into the tolerations of the pod.
The resulting tolerations are checked against a list of allowed tolerations annotated to the namespace.
If the check succeeds, the pod request is admitted otherwise it is rejected.

If the namespace of the pod does not have any associated default tolerations or allowed
tolerations annotated, the cluster-level default tolerations or cluster-level list of allowed tolerations are used
instead if they are specified.

Tolerations to a namespace are assigned via the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations` annotation key.
The list of allowed tolerations can be added via the `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerationsWhitelist` annotation key.

Example for namespace annotations:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: apps-that-need-nodes-exclusively
  annotations:
    scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultTolerations: '[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "dedicated-node"}]'
    scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerationsWhitelist: '[{"operator": "Exists", "effect": "NoSchedule", "key": "dedicated-node"}]'
```

This admission controller is disabled by default.

### Priority {#priority}

The priority admission controller uses the `priorityClassName` field and populates the integer
value of the priority.
If the priority class is not found, the Pod is rejected.

### ResourceQuota {#resourcequota}

This admission controller will observe the incoming request and ensure that it does not violate
any of the constraints enumerated in the `ResourceQuota` object in a `Namespace`.  If you are
using `ResourceQuota` objects in your Kubernetes deployment, you MUST use this admission
controller to enforce quota constraints.

See the [ResourceQuota API reference](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/policy-resources/resource-quota-v1/)
and the [example of Resource Quota](/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) for more details.

### RuntimeClass {#runtimeclass}

If you define a RuntimeClass with [Pod overhead](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/)
configured, this admission controller checks incoming Pods.
When enabled, this admission controller rejects any Pod create requests
that have the overhead already set.
For Pods that have a RuntimeClass configured and selected in their `.spec`,
this admission controller sets `.spec.overhead` in the Pod based on the value
defined in the corresponding RuntimeClass.

See also [Pod Overhead](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-overhead/)
for more information.

### SecurityContextDeny {#securitycontextdeny}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.27" state="deprecated" >}}

{{< caution >}}
The Kubernetes project recommends that you **do not use** the
`SecurityContextDeny` admission controller.

The `SecurityContextDeny` admission controller plugin is deprecated and disabled
by default. It will be removed in a future version. If you choose to enable the
`SecurityContextDeny` admission controller plugin, you must enable the
`SecurityContextDeny` feature gate as well.

The `SecurityContextDeny` admission plugin is deprecated because it is outdated
and incomplete; it may be unusable or not do what you would expect. As
implemented, this plugin is unable to restrict all security-sensitive attributes
of the Pod API. For example, the `privileged` and `ephemeralContainers` fields
were never restricted by this plugin.

The [Pod Security Admission](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)
plugin enforcing the [Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
`Restricted` profile captures what this plugin was trying to achieve in a better
and up-to-date way.
{{< /caution >}}

This admission controller will deny any Pod that attempts to set the following
[SecurityContext](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#security-context)
fields:
- `.spec.securityContext.supplementalGroups`
- `.spec.securityContext.seLinuxOptions`
- `.spec.securityContext.runAsUser`
- `.spec.securityContext.fsGroup`
- `.spec.(init)Containers[*].securityContext.seLinuxOptions`
- `.spec.(init)Containers[*].securityContext.runAsUser`

For more historical context on this plugin, see
[The birth of PodSecurityPolicy](/blog/2022/08/23/podsecuritypolicy-the-historical-context/#the-birth-of-podsecuritypolicy)
from the Kubernetes blog article about PodSecurityPolicy and its removal. The
article details the PodSecurityPolicy historical context and the birth of the
`securityContext` field for Pods.

### ServiceAccount {#serviceaccount}

This admission controller implements automation for
[serviceAccounts](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).
The Kubernetes project strongly recommends enabling this admission controller.
You should enable this admission controller if you intend to make any use of Kubernetes
`ServiceAccount` objects.

### StorageObjectInUseProtection

The `StorageObjectInUseProtection` plugin adds the `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection` or `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`
finalizers to newly created Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) or Persistent Volumes (PV).
In case a user deletes a PVC or PV the PVC or PV is not removed until the finalizer is removed
from the PVC or PV by PVC or PV Protection Controller.
Refer to the
[Storage Object in Use Protection](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#storage-object-in-use-protection)
for more detailed information.

### TaintNodesByCondition {#taintnodesbycondition}

This admission controller {{< glossary_tooltip text="taints" term_id="taint" >}} newly created
Nodes as `NotReady` and `NoSchedule`. That tainting avoids a race condition that could cause Pods
to be scheduled on new Nodes before their taints were updated to accurately reflect their reported
conditions.

### ValidatingAdmissionPolicy {#validatingadmissionpolicy}

[This admission controller](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/) implements the CEL validation for incoming matched requests. 
It is enabled when both feature gate `validatingadmissionpolicy` and `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1alpha1` group/version are enabled.
If any of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy fails, the request fails.

### ValidatingAdmissionWebhook {#validatingadmissionwebhook}

This admission controller calls any validating webhooks which match the request. Matching
webhooks are called in parallel; if any of them rejects the request, the request
fails. This admission controller only runs in the validation phase; the webhooks it calls may not
mutate the object, as opposed to the webhooks called by the `MutatingAdmissionWebhook` admission controller.

If a webhook called by this has side effects (for example, decrementing quota) it
*must* have a reconciliation system, as it is not guaranteed that subsequent
webhooks or other validating admission controllers will permit the request to finish.

If you disable the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook, you must also disable the
`ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` object in the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`
group/version via the `--runtime-config` flag.

## Is there a recommended set of admission controllers to use?

Yes. The recommended admission controllers are enabled by default
(shown [here](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/#options)),
so you do not need to explicitly specify them.
You can enable additional admission controllers beyond the default set using the
`--enable-admission-plugins` flag (**order doesn't matter**).
