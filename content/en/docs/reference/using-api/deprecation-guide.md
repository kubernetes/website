<!-- overview -->

As the Kubernetes API evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized or upgraded.
When APIs evolve, the old API is deprecated and eventually removed.
This page contains information you need to know when migrating from
deprecated API versions to newer and more stable API versions.

## What To Do

Kubernetes 1.22 will be released later in 2021, so be sure to audit
your configuration and integrations now!

### Test with deprecated APIs disabled

You can test your clusters by starting an API server with specific API versions disabled
to simulate upcoming removals. Add the following flag to the API server startup arguments:

`--runtime-config=$group/$version=false`

For example:

`--runtime-config=admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1=false,apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1,...`

### Locate use of deprecated APIs

Use [client warnings, metrics, and audit information available in 1.19+](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/#deprecation-warnings)
to locate use of deprecated APIs.

### Migrate to non-deprecated APIs

* Update custom integrations and controllers to call the non-deprecated APIs
* Change YAML files to reference the non-deprecated APIs

    You can use the `kubectl-convert` command (`kubectl convert` prior to v1.20)
    to automatically convert an existing object:
    
    `kubectl-convert -f <file> --output-version <group>/<version>`.

    For example, to convert an older Deployment to `apps/v1`, you can run:
    
    `kubectl-convert -f ./my-deployment.yaml --output-version apps/v1`

    Note that this may use non-ideal default values. To learn more about a specific
    resource, check the Kubernetes [api reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/#api-reference).
