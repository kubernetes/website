<!-- overview -->
During `kubeadm init`, kubeadm uploads the `ClusterConfiguration` object to your cluster
in a ConfigMap called `kubeadm-config` in the `kube-system` namespace. This configuration is then read during
`kubeadm join`, `kubeadm reset` and `kubeadm upgrade`. To view this ConfigMap call `kubeadm config view`.

You can use `kubeadm config print` to print the default configuration and `kubeadm config migrate` to
convert your old configuration files to a newer version. `kubeadm config images list` and
`kubeadm config images pull` can be used to list and pull the images that kubeadm requires.

For more information navigate to
[Using kubeadm init with a configuration file](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/#config-file)
or [Using kubeadm join with a configuration file](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/#config-file).

You can also configure several kubelet-configuration options with `kubeadm init`. These options will be the same on any node in your cluster. 
See [Configuring each kubelet in your cluster using kubeadm](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/kubelet-integration/) for details.

In Kubernetes v1.13.0 and later to list/pull kube-dns images instead of the CoreDNS image
the `--config` method described [here](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init-phase/#cmd-phase-addon)
has to be used.
