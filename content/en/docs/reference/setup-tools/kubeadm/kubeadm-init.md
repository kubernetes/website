### Init workflow {#init-workflow}

`kubeadm init` bootstraps a Kubernetes control-plane node by executing the
following steps:

1. Runs a series of pre-flight checks to validate the system state
   before making changes. Some checks only trigger warnings, others are
   considered errors and will exit kubeadm until the problem is corrected or the
   user specifies `--ignore-preflight-errors=<list-of-errors>`.

1. Generates a self-signed CA to set up identities for each component in the cluster. The user can provide their
   own CA cert and/or key by dropping it in the cert directory configured via `--cert-dir`
   (`/etc/kubernetes/pki` by default).
   The APIServer certs will have additional SAN entries for any `--apiserver-cert-extra-sans` arguments, lowercased if necessary.

1. Writes kubeconfig files in `/etc/kubernetes/`  for
   the kubelet, the controller-manager and the scheduler to use to connect to the
   API server, each with its own identity, as well as an additional
   kubeconfig file for administration named `admin.conf`.

1. Generates static Pod manifests for the API server,
   controller-manager and scheduler. In case an external etcd is not provided,
   an additional static Pod manifest is generated for etcd.

   Static Pod manifests are written to `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`; the kubelet
   watches this directory for Pods to create on startup.

   Once control plane Pods are up and running, the `kubeadm init` sequence can continue.

1. Apply labels and taints to the control-plane node so that no additional workloads will
   run there.

1. Generates the token that additional nodes can use to register
   themselves with a control-plane in the future. Optionally, the user can provide a
   token via `--token`, as described in the
   [kubeadm token](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-token/) docs.

1. Makes all the necessary configurations for allowing node joining with the
   [Bootstrap Tokens](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) and
   [TLS Bootstrap](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/)
   mechanism:

   - Write a ConfigMap for making available all the information required
     for joining, and set up related RBAC access rules.

   - Let Bootstrap Tokens access the CSR signing API.

   - Configure auto-approval for new CSR requests.

   See [kubeadm join](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/) for additional info.

1. Installs a DNS server (CoreDNS) and the kube-proxy addon components via the API server.
   In Kubernetes version 1.11 and later CoreDNS is the default DNS server.
   Please note that although the DNS server is deployed, it will not be scheduled until CNI is installed.

   {{< warning >}}
   kube-dns usage with kubeadm is deprecated as of v1.18 and is removed in v1.21.

### Using init phases with kubeadm {#init-phases}

Kubeadm allows you to create a control-plane node in phases using the `kubeadm init phase` command.

To view the ordered list of phases and sub-phases you can call `kubeadm init --help`. The list will be located at the top of the help screen and each phase will have a description next to it.
Note that by calling `kubeadm init` all of the phases and sub-phases will be executed in this exact order.

Some phases have unique flags, so if you want to have a look at the list of available options add `--help`, for example:

```shell
sudo kubeadm init phase control-plane controller-manager --help
```

You can also use `--help` to see the list of sub-phases for a certain parent phase:

```shell
sudo kubeadm init phase control-plane --help
```

`kubeadm init` also exposes a flag called `--skip-phases` that can be used to skip certain phases. The flag accepts a list of phase names and the names can be taken from the above ordered list.

An example:

```shell
sudo kubeadm init phase control-plane all --config=configfile.yaml
sudo kubeadm init phase etcd local --config=configfile.yaml
# you can now modify the control plane and etcd manifest files
sudo kubeadm init --skip-phases=control-plane,etcd --config=configfile.yaml
```

What this example would do is write the manifest files for the control plane and etcd in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` based on the configuration in `configfile.yaml`. This allows you to modify the files and then skip these phases using `--skip-phases`. By calling the last command you will create a control plane node with the custom manifest files.

### Using kubeadm init with a configuration file {#config-file}

{{< caution >}}
The config file is still considered beta and may change in future versions.
{{< /caution >}}

It's possible to configure `kubeadm init` with a configuration file instead of command
line flags, and some more advanced features may only be available as
configuration file options. This file is passed using the `--config` flag and it must
contain a `ClusterConfiguration` structure and optionally more structures separated by `---\n`
Mixing `--config` with others flags may not be allowed in some cases.

The default configuration can be printed out using the
[kubeadm config print](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-config/) command.

If your configuration is not using the latest version it is **recommended** that you migrate using
the [kubeadm config migrate](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-config/) command.

For more information on the fields and usage of the configuration you can navigate to our API reference
page and pick a version from [the list](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/apis/kubeadm#pkg-subdirectories).

### Adding kube-proxy parameters {#kube-proxy}

For information about kube-proxy parameters in the kubeadm configuration see:
- [kube-proxy](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/proxy/apis/config#KubeProxyConfiguration)

For information about enabling IPVS mode with kubeadm see:
- [IPVS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/ipvs/README.md)

### Passing custom flags to control plane components {#control-plane-flags}

For information about passing flags to control plane components see:
- [control-plane-flags](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/)

### Using custom images {#custom-images}

By default, kubeadm pulls images from `k8s.gcr.io`. If the
requested Kubernetes version is a CI label (such as `ci/latest`)
`gcr.io/kubernetes-ci-images` is used.

You can override this behavior by using [kubeadm with a configuration file](#config-file).
Allowed customization are:

* To provide an alternative `imageRepository` to be used instead of
  `k8s.gcr.io`.
* To set `useHyperKubeImage` to `true` to use the HyperKube image.
* To provide a specific `imageRepository` and `imageTag` for etcd or DNS add-on.

Please note that the configuration field `kubernetesVersion` or the command line flag
`--kubernetes-version` affect the version of the images.

### Uploading control-plane certificates to the cluster

By adding the flag `--upload-certs` to `kubeadm init` you can temporary upload
the control-plane certificates to a Secret in the cluster. Please note that this Secret
will expire automatically after 2 hours. The certificates are encrypted using
a 32byte key that can be specified using `--certificate-key`. The same key can be used
to download the certificates when additional control-plane nodes are joining, by passing
`--control-plane` and `--certificate-key` to `kubeadm join`.

The following phase command can be used to re-upload the certificates after expiration:

```shell
kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs --certificate-key=SOME_VALUE --config=SOME_YAML_FILE
```

If the flag `--certificate-key` is not passed to `kubeadm init` and
`kubeadm init phase upload-certs` a new key will be generated automatically.

The following command can be used to generate a new key on demand:

```shell
kubeadm certs certificate-key
```

### Certificate management with kubeadm

For detailed information on certificate management with kubeadm see
[Certificate Management with kubeadm](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/).
The document includes information about using external CA, custom certificates
and certificate renewal.

### Managing the kubeadm drop-in file for the kubelet {#kubelet-drop-in}

The `kubeadm` package ships with a configuration file for running the `kubelet` by `systemd`. Note that the kubeadm CLI never touches this drop-in file. This drop-in file is part of the kubeadm DEB/RPM package.

For further information, see [Managing the kubeadm drop-in file for systemd](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/kubelet-integration/#the-kubelet-drop-in-file-for-systemd).

### Use kubeadm with CRI runtimes

By default kubeadm attempts to detect your container runtime. For more details on this detection, see
the [kubeadm CRI installation guide](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-runtime).

### Setting the node name

By default, `kubeadm` assigns a node name based on a machine's host address. You can override this setting with the `--node-name` flag.
The flag passes the appropriate [`--hostname-override`](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/#options)
value to the kubelet.

Be aware that overriding the hostname can [interfere with cloud providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/8873).

### Running kubeadm without an internet connection

For running kubeadm without an internet connection you have to pre-pull the required control-plane images.

You can list and pull the images using the `kubeadm config images` sub-command:

```shell
kubeadm config images list
kubeadm config images pull
```

All images that kubeadm requires such as `k8s.gcr.io/kube-*`, `k8s.gcr.io/etcd` and `k8s.gcr.io/pause` support multiple architectures.

### Automating kubeadm

Rather than copying the token you obtained from `kubeadm init` to each node, as
in the [basic kubeadm tutorial](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/), you can parallelize the
token distribution for easier automation. To implement this automation, you must
know the IP address that the control-plane node will have after it is started,
or use a DNS name or an address of a load balancer.

1. Generate a token. This token must have the form  `<6 character string>.<16
   character string>`. More formally, it must match the regex:
   `[a-z0-9]{6}\.[a-z0-9]{16}`.

   kubeadm can generate a token for you:

   ```shell
    kubeadm token generate
   ```

1. Start both the control-plane node and the worker nodes concurrently with this token.
   As they come up they should find each other and form the cluster.  The same
   `--token` argument can be used on both `kubeadm init` and `kubeadm join`.

1. Similar can be done for `--certificate-key` when joining additional control-plane
   nodes. The key can be generated using:

   ```shell
   kubeadm certs certificate-key
   ```

Once the cluster is up, you can grab the admin credentials from the control-plane node
at `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf` and use that to talk to the cluster.

Note that this style of bootstrap has some relaxed security guarantees because
it does not allow the root CA hash to be validated with
`--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash` (since it's not generated when the nodes are
provisioned). For details, see the [kubeadm join](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-join/).
