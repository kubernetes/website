### External etcd clean up!

`kubeadm reset` will not delete any etcd data if external etcd is used. This means that if you run `kubeadm init` again using the same etcd endpoints, you will see state from previous clusters. 

To wipe etcd data it is recommended you use a client like etcdctl, such as:

```bash
etcdctl del "" --prefix
```

See the [etcd documentation](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/etcdctl) for more information.
