In v1.15.0, kubeadm introduced preliminary support for `kubeadm upgrade node` phases.
Phases for other `kubeadm upgrade` sub-commands such as `apply`, could be added in the
following releases.

## kubeadm upgrade node phase {#cmd-node-phase}

Using this phase you can choose to execute the separate steps of the upgrade of
secondary control-plane or worker nodes. Please note that `kubeadm upgrade apply` still has to
be called on a primary control-plane node.
