Garbage collection is a collective term for the various mechanisms Kubernetes uses to clean up
cluster resources. 

<!--more-->

Kubernetes uses garbage collection to clean up resources like
[unused containers and images](/docs/concepts/architecture/garbage-collection/#containers-images),
[failed Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-garbage-collection),
[objects owned by the targeted resource](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/),
[completed Jobs](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/ttlafterfinished/), and resources
that have expired or failed.
