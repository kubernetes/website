Working groups are a way of organizing people to accomplish a discrete task, and are relatively easy to create and deprecate when inactive.

For more information, see the [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) repo and the current list of [SIGs and working groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).
