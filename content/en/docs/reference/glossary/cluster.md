A set of machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes. A cluster has at least one worker node and at least one master node. 

<!--more-->
The worker node(s) host the pods that are the components of the application. The master node(s) manages the worker nodes and the pods in the cluster. Multiple master nodes are used to provide a cluster with failover and high availability.
