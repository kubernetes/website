 A security-minded, standards-based container engine.

<!--more--> 

rkt is an application {{< glossary_tooltip text="container" term_id="container" >}} engine featuring a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}}-native approach, a pluggable execution environment, and a well-defined surface area. rkt allows users to apply different configurations at both the Pod and application level. Each Pod executes directly in the classic Unix process model, in a self-contained, isolated environment.
