 Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

<!--more-->

If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a
[back up](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/#backing-up-an-etcd-cluster) plan
for those data.

You can find in-depth information about etcd in the official [documentation](https://etcd.io/docs/).
