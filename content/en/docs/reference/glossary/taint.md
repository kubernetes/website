 A core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Taints prevent the scheduling of {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}} on {{< glossary_tooltip text="nodes" term_id="node" >}} or node groups.

<!--more-->

Taints and {{< glossary_tooltip text="tolerations" term_id="toleration" >}} work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node. A node should only schedule a Pod with the matching tolerations for the configured taints.
