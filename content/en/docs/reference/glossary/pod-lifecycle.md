The [Pod Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/) is a high level summary of where a Pod is in its lifecyle.  A Podâ€™s `status` field is a [PodStatus](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.13/#podstatus-v1-core) object, which has a `phase` field that displays one of the following phases: Running, Pending, Succeeded, Failed, Unknown, Completed, or CrashLoopBackOff.
