[Pod disruption](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) is the process by which Pods on Nodes are terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily. 

Voluntary disruptions are started intentionally by application owners or cluster administrators. Involuntary disruptions are unintentional and can be triggered by unavoidable issues like Nodes running out of resources, or by accidental deletions.
