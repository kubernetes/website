 May refer to: code in the Kubernetes ecosystem that depends upon the core Kubernetes codebase or a forked repo.

<!--more--> 

* In the **Kubernetes Community**: Conversations often use *downstream* to mean the ecosystem, code, or third-party tools that rely on the core Kubernetes codebase. For example, a new feature in Kubernetes may be adopted by applications *downstream* to improve their functionality.
* In **GitHub** or **git**: The convention is to refer to a forked repo as *downstream*, whereas the source repo is considered *upstream*.
