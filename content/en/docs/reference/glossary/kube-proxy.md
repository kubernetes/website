 [kube-proxy](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/) is a
network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of
the Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service">}} concept.

<!--more-->

kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow
network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside
of your cluster.

kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one
and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.
