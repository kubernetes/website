A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.

- **matchExpressions** ([]LabelSelectorRequirement)

  matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

  <a name="LabelSelectorRequirement"></a>
  *A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.*

  - **matchExpressions.key** (string), required

    *Patch strategy: merge on key `key`*
    
    key is the label key that the selector applies to.

  - **matchExpressions.operator** (string), required

    operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

  - **matchExpressions.values** ([]string)

    values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

- **matchLabels** (map[string]string)

  matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
