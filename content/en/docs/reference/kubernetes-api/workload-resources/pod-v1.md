### Containers


- **containers** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Container" >}}">Container</a>), required

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be updated.

- **initContainers** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Container" >}}">Container</a>)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/

- **imagePullSecrets** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/local-object-reference#LocalObjectReference" >}}">LocalObjectReference</a>)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `name`*
  
  ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec. If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only DockerConfig type secrets are honored. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod

- **enableServiceLinks** (boolean)

  EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker links. Optional: Defaults to true.

### Volumes


- **volumes** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../config-and-storage-resources/volume#Volume" >}}">Volume</a>)

  *Patch strategies: retainKeys, merge on key `name`*
  
  List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

### Scheduling


- **nodeSelector** (map[string]string)

  NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/

- **nodeName** (string)

  NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. If it is non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, assuming that it fits resource requirements.

- **affinity** (Affinity)

  If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

  <a name="Affinity"></a>
  *Affinity is a group of affinity scheduling rules.*

  - **affinity.nodeAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#NodeAffinity" >}}">NodeAffinity</a>)

    Describes node affinity scheduling rules for the pod.

  - **affinity.podAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodAffinity" >}}">PodAffinity</a>)

    Describes pod affinity scheduling rules (e.g. co-locate this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

  - **affinity.podAntiAffinity** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#PodAntiAffinity" >}}">PodAntiAffinity</a>)

    Describes pod anti-affinity scheduling rules (e.g. avoid putting this pod in the same node, zone, etc. as some other pod(s)).

- **tolerations** ([]Toleration)

  If specified, the pod's tolerations.

  <a name="Toleration"></a>
  *The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.*

  - **tolerations.key** (string)

    Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

  - **tolerations.operator** (string)

    Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

  - **tolerations.value** (string)

    Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.

  - **tolerations.effect** (string)

    Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

  - **tolerations.tolerationSeconds** (int64)

    TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

- **schedulerName** (string)

  If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.

- **runtimeClassName** (string)

  RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.

- **priorityClassName** (string)

  If specified, indicates the pod's priority. "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.

- **priority** (int32)

  The priority value. Various system components use this field to find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the priority.

- **topologySpreadConstraints** ([]TopologySpreadConstraint)

  *Patch strategy: merge on key `topologyKey`*
  
  *Map: unique values on keys `topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable` will be kept during a merge*
  
  TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods in a way which abides by the constraints. All topologySpreadConstraints are ANDed.

  <a name="TopologySpreadConstraint"></a>
  *TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.*

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.maxSkew** (int32), required

    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |   P   |   P   |       | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.topologyKey** (string), required

    TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each \<key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.whenUnsatisfiable** (string), required

    WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
      skew.
    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assigment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

  - **topologySpreadConstraints.labelSelector** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/label-selector#LabelSelector" >}}">LabelSelector</a>)

    LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). If this value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. Defaults to 30 seconds.

- **activeDeadlineSeconds** (int64)

  Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

- **readinessGates** ([]PodReadinessGate)

  If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions specified in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info: https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md

  <a name="PodReadinessGate"></a>

- **setHostnameAsFQDN** (boolean)

  If true the pod's hostname will be configured as the pod's FQDN, rather than the leaf name (the default). In Linux containers, this means setting the FQDN in the hostname field of the kernel (the nodename field of struct utsname). In Windows containers, this means setting the registry value of hostname for the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters to FQDN. If a pod does not have FQDN, this has no effect. Default to false.

- **subdomain** (string)

  - **lifecycle.postStart** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks

  - **lifecycle.preStop** (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Handler" >}}">Handler</a>)

    PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The reason for termination is passed to the handler. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace period.

If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed. This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

- **stdinOnce** (boolean)

  Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

  *ExecAction describes a "run in container" action.*

  - **exec.command** ([]string)

    Command is the command line to execute inside the container, the working directory for the command  is root ('/') in the container's filesystem. The command is simply exec'd, it is not run inside a shell, so traditional shell instructions ('|', etc) won't work. To use a shell, you need to explicitly call out to that shell. Exit status of 0 is treated as live/healthy and non-zero is unhealthy.

- **httpGet** (HTTPGetAction)

  HTTPGet specifies the http request to perform.

  <a name="HTTPGetAction"></a>
  *HTTPGetAction describes an action based on HTTP Get requests.*

    <a name="IntOrString"></a>
    *IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.*

  - **httpGet.host** (string)

    Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead.

  - **httpGet.httpHeaders** ([]HTTPHeader)

  Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is an alpha field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.

- **periodSeconds** (int32)

  How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.

- **timeoutSeconds** (int32)

  Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

  nominatedNodeName is set only when this pod preempts other pods on the node, but it cannot be scheduled right away as preemption victims receive their graceful termination periods. This field does not guarantee that the pod will be scheduled on this node. Scheduler may decide to place the pod elsewhere if other nodes become available sooner. Scheduler may also decide to give the resources on this node to a higher priority pod that is created after preemption. As a result, this field may be different than PodSpec.nodeName when the pod is scheduled.

- **phase** (string)

  The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. There are five possible phase values:
  
  Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while. Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting. Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.

## PodList {#PodList}

PodList is a list of Pods.

<hr>

- **items** ([]<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Pod" >}}">Pod</a>), required

  List of pods. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md

- **apiVersion** (string)

  APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

- **kind** (string)

  Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

- **metadata** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/list-meta#ListMeta" >}}">ListMeta</a>)

### `get` read the specified Pod

#### HTTP Request

GET /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}

#### Parameters


- **name** (*in path*): string, required

  name of the Pod


- **namespace** (*in path*): string, required

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#namespace" >}}">namespace</a>


- **pretty** (*in query*): string

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#pretty" >}}">pretty</a>



#### Response


200 (<a href="{{< ref "../workload-resources/pod-v1#Pod" >}}">Pod</a>): OK

401: Unauthorized


### `get` read log of the specified Pod

#### HTTP Request

GET /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/log

#### Parameters


- **name** (*in path*): string, required

  name of the Pod


- **namespace** (*in path*): string, required

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#namespace" >}}">namespace</a>


- **container** (*in query*): string

  The container for which to stream logs. Defaults to only container if there is one container in the pod.


- **follow** (*in query*): boolean

  Follow the log stream of the pod. Defaults to false.


- **insecureSkipTLSVerifyBackend** (*in query*): boolean

  insecureSkipTLSVerifyBackend indicates that the apiserver should not confirm the validity of the serving certificate of the backend it is connecting to.  This will make the HTTPS connection between the apiserver and the backend insecure. This means the apiserver cannot verify the log data it is receiving came from the real kubelet.  If the kubelet is configured to verify the apiserver's TLS credentials, it does not mean the connection to the real kubelet is vulnerable to a man in the middle attack (e.g. an attacker could not intercept the actual log data coming from the real kubelet).


- **limitBytes** (*in query*): integer

  If set, the number of bytes to read from the server before terminating the log output. This may not display a complete final line of logging, and may return slightly more or slightly less than the specified limit.


- **pretty** (*in query*): string

  <a href="{{< ref "../common-parameters/common-parameters#pretty" >}}">pretty</a>


- **previous** (*in query*): boolean

  Return previous terminated container logs. Defaults to false.


- **sinceSeconds** (*in query*): integer

  A relative time in seconds before the current time from which to show logs. If this value precedes the time a pod was started, only logs since the pod start will be returned. If this value is in the future, no logs will be returned. Only one of sinceSeconds or sinceTime may be specified.


- **tailLines** (*in query*): integer

  If set, the number of lines from the end of the logs to show. If not specified, logs are shown from the creation of the container or sinceSeconds or sinceTime


- **timestamps** (*in query*): boolean

  If true, add an RFC3339 or RFC3339Nano timestamp at the beginning of every line of log output. Defaults to false.
