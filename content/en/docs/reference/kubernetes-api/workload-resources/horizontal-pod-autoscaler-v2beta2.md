  maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas.

- **scaleTargetRef** (CrossVersionObjectReference), required

  scaleTargetRef points to the target resource to scale, and is used to the pods for which metrics should be collected, as well as to actually change the replica count.

- **minReplicas** (int32)

  minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available.

- **behavior** (HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior)

  behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used.

StabilizationWindowSeconds must be greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 3600 (one hour). If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the stabilization window is 300 seconds long).

  - **behavior.scaleUp** (HPAScalingRules)

    scaleUp is scaling policy for scaling Up. If not set, the default value is the higher of:
      * increase no more than 4 pods per 60 seconds
      * double the number of pods per 60 seconds

If not set, use the default values: - For scale up: 0 (i.e. no stabilization is done). - For scale down: 300 (i.e. the stabilization window is 300 seconds long).

- **metrics** ([]MetricSpec)

  metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods.

If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization.

    name is the name of the given metric

  - **currentMetrics.pods.metric.selector** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/label-selector#LabelSelector" >}}">LabelSelector</a>)

    selector is the string-encoded form of a standard kubernetes label selector for the given metric When set, it is passed as an additional parameter to the metrics server for more specific metrics scoping. When unset, just the metricName will be used to gather metrics.

  - **currentMetrics.resource** (ResourceMetricStatus)

    resource refers to a resource metric (such as those specified in requests and limits) known to Kubernetes describing each pod in the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory). Such metrics are built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.

    <a name="ResourceMetricStatus"></a>
    *ResourceMetricStatus indicates the current value of a resource metric known to Kubernetes, as specified in requests and limits, describing each pod in the current scale target (e.g. CPU or memory).  Such metrics are built in to Kubernetes, and have special scaling options on top of those available to normal per-pod metrics using the "pods" source.*

  - **currentMetrics.resource.current** (MetricValueStatus), required

    current contains the current value for the given metric

    <a name="MetricValueStatus"></a>
    *MetricValueStatus holds the current value for a metric*

  - **currentMetrics.resource.current.averageUtilization** (int32)

    currentAverageUtilization is the current value of the average of the resource metric across all relevant pods, represented as a percentage of the requested value of the resource for the pods.

  - **currentMetrics.resource.current.averageValue** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/quantity#Quantity" >}}">Quantity</a>)

    averageValue is the current value of the average of the metric across all relevant pods (as a quantity)

  - **currentMetrics.resource.current.value** (<a href="{{< ref "../common-definitions/quantity#Quantity" >}}">Quantity</a>)

    value is the current value of the metric (as a quantity).

  - **currentMetrics.resource.name** (string), required

    Name is the name of the resource in question.

- **lastScaleTime** (Time)

  lastScaleTime is the last time the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scaled the number of pods, used by the autoscaler to control how often the number of pods is changed.

  <a name="Time"></a>
  *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **observedGeneration** (int64)

  observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
