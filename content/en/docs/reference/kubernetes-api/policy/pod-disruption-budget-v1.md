IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.  AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

      <td><code>shardSelector</code></td>
      <td><em>string</em></td>
      <td>shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:    shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')   shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')  Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:   - object.metadata.uid   - object.metadata.namespace  hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.  Examples:   2-shard split:     shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')     shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')   4-shard split:     shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')     shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')     shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')     shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.</td>
