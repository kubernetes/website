## ResourceSlice {#ResourceSlice}

ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.

At the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple &lt;driver name&gt;, &lt;pool name&gt;, &lt;device name&gt;.

Whenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.

When allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.

For resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.

How the field is used also depends on whether `capacityKey` is set. 1.  If `capacityKey` is NOT set: `allocationMultiplier` multiplies the device count allocated to the claim. 	   a. A DRA driver representing each CPU core as a device would have        {ResourceName: "cpu", allocationMultiplier: "2"} in its        `nodeAllocatableResourceMappings`. If 4 devices are allocated to the claim, 		  4 * 2 CPUs would be considered as allocated and subtracted from the node's capacity.     b. A GPU device that needs additional node memory per GPU allocation would        have {ResourceName: "memory", allocationMultiplier: "2Gi"}.  Each allocated 		  GPU device instance of this type will account for 2Gi of memory.  2.  If `capacityKey` IS set: `allocationMultiplier` is multiplied by the amount of that capacity consumed.

For example, if `spec.devices[*].capacity` has an entry "dra.example.com/memory": "128Gi", and this field is set to "dra.example.com/memory", then for a claim allocation that consumes { "dra.example.com/memory": "4Gi" } the base quantity for the node allocatable resource mapping will be "4Gi", and `allocationMultiplier` should be omitted or set to "1".</td>

## NodeSelectorRequirement {#NodeSelectorRequirement}

A node selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

## ResourcePool {#ResourcePool}

ResourcePool describes the pool that ResourceSlices belong to.

The generation may be reset by drivers, which should be fine for consumers, assuming that all ResourceSlices in a pool are updated to match or deleted.  Combined with ResourceSliceCount, this mechanism enables consumers to detect pools which are comprised of multiple ResourceSlices and are in an incomplete state.</td>

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.  The server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

      <td>shardSelector restricts the list of returned objects using a CEL-based shard selector expression. The format uses the shardRange() function combined with || (logical OR) to specify one or more hash ranges:    shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000')   shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0', '0x8000000000000000') || shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')  Field paths use CEL-style object-rooted syntax (e.g. "object.metadata.uid"), NOT the fieldSelector format ("metadata.uid"). Currently supported paths:   - object.metadata.uid   - object.metadata.namespace  hexStart and hexEnd are single-quoted CEL string literals with a '0x' prefix, defining the inclusive lower and exclusive upper bounds over the 64-bit FNV-1a hash space. The full range is [0x0, 0x10000000000000000), where the exclusive upper bound equals 2^64.  Examples:   2-shard split:     shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')     shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')   4-shard split:     shard 0: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x0000000000000000', '0x4000000000000000')     shard 1: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x4000000000000000', '0x8000000000000000')     shard 2: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0x8000000000000000', '0xc000000000000000')     shard 3: shardRange(object.metadata.uid, '0xc000000000000000', '0x10000000000000000')  This is an alpha field and requires enabling the ShardedListAndWatch feature gate.</td>
