Enables shims and translation logic to route volume
operations from the Azure-File in-tree plugin to AzureFile CSI plugin.
Supports falling back to in-tree AzureFile plugin for mount operations to
nodes that have the feature disabled or that do not have AzureFile CSI plugin
installed and configured. Does not support falling back for provision
operations, for those the CSI plugin must be installed and configured.
Requires CSIMigration feature flag enabled.
