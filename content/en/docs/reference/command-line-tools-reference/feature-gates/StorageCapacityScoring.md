The feature gate `VolumeCapacityPriority` was used in v1.32 to support storage that are
statically provisioned. Starting from v1.33, the new feature gate `StorageCapacityScoring`
replaces the old `VolumeCapacityPriority` gate with added support to dynamically provisioned storage.
When `StorageCapacityScoring` is enabled, the VolumeBinding plugin in the kube-scheduler is extended
to score Nodes based on the storage capacity on each of them.
This feature is applicable to CSI volumes that supported [Storage Capacity](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/),
including local storage backed by a CSI driver.
