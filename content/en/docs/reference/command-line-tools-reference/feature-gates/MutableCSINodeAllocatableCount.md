When this feature gate is enabled, the `.spec.drivers[*].allocatable.count` field of a CSINode becomes mutable, and a new field, `nodeAllocatableUpdatePeriodSeconds`, is available in the CSIDriver object. This allows periodic updates to a node's reported allocatable volume capacity, preventing stateful pods from becoming stuck due to outdated information that the kube-scheduler relies on.
