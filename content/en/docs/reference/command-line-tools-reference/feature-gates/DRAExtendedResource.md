Enables support for the [Extended Resource allocation by DRA](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#extended-resources-allocation-by-dra) feature.
It makes it possible to specify an extended resource name in a DeviceClass.

This feature gate has no effect unless the `DynamicResourceAllocation` feature gate is enabled.
