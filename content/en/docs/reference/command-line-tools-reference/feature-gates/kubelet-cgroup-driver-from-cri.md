Enable detection of the kubelet cgroup driver
configuration option from the {{<glossary_tooltip term_id="cri" text="CRI">}}.
You can use this feature gate on nodes with a kubelet that supports the feature gate
and where there is a CRI container runtime that supports the `RuntimeConfig`
CRI call. If both CRI and kubelet support this feature, the kubelet ignores the
`cgroupDriver` configuration setting (or deprecated `--cgroup-driver` command
line argument). If you enable this feature gate and the container runtime
doesn't support it, the kubelet falls back to using the driver configured using
the `cgroupDriver` configuration setting.
See [Configuring a cgroup driver](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/configure-cgroup-driver)
for more details.
