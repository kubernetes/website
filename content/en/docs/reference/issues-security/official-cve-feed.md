This feed is auto-refreshing with a noticeable but small lag (minutes to hours)
from the time a CVE is announced to the time it is accessible in this feed.

The source of truth of this feed is a set of GitHub Issues, filtered by a controlled and
restricted label `official-cve-feed`. The raw data is stored in a Google Cloud
Bucket which is writable only by a small number of trusted members of the
Community.
