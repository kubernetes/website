# Before you get started

## Sign the CLA

Before you can contribute, you will need to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/CLA.md).

## Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Setting up your development environment

If you havenâ€™t set up your environment, please find resources [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel).

## Community Expectations and Roles

Kubernetes is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on its community to provide a productive, friendly and collaborative environment.

- Read and review the [Community Expectations](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/community-expectations.md) for an understand of code and review expectations. 
- See [Community Membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/community-membership.md) for a list the various responsibilities of contributor roles. You are encouraged to move up this contributor ladder as you gain experience.  

# Your First Contribution

Have you ever wanted to contribute to the coolest cloud technology? We will help you understand the organization of the Kubernetes project and direct you to the best places to get started. You'll be able to pick up issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged.

Please be aware that due to the large number of issues our triage team deals with, we cannot offer technical support in GitHub issues. If you have questions about the development process, feel free to jump into our [Slack Channel](http://slack.k8s.io/) or join our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-dev). You can also ask questions on [ServerFault](https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes). The Kubernetes team scans Stack Overflow on a regular basis and will try to ensure your questions don't go unanswered.

## Find something to work on

Help is always welcome! For example, documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement. There's always code that can be clarified and variables or functions that can be renamed or commented. There's always a need for more test coverage.
You get the idea - if you ever see something you think should be fixed, you should own it. Here is how you get started.

### Find a good first topic

There are multiple repositories within the Kubernetes community and a full list of repositories can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/).
Each repository in the Kubernetes organization has beginner-friendly issues that provide a good first issue. For example, [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes) has [help wanted issues](https://go.k8s.io/help-wanted) that should not need deep knowledge of the system.
Another good strategy is to find a documentation improvement, such as a missing/broken link, which will give you exposure to the code submission/review process without the added complication of technical depth. Please see [Contributing](#contributing) below for the workflow.

### Learn about SIGs

#### Sig structure

You may have noticed that some repositories in the Kubernetes Organization are owned by Special Interest Groups, or SIGs. We organize the Kubernetes community into SIGs in order to improve our workflow and more easily manage what is a very large community project. The developers within each SIG have autonomy and ownership over that SIG's part of Kubernetes.

Some SIGs also have their own `CONTRIBUTING.md` files, which may contain extra information or guidelines in addition to these general ones. These are located in the SIG-specific community directories. For example: the contributor's guide for SIG CLI is located in the *kubernetes/community* repo, as [`/sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Like everything else in Kubernetes, a SIG is an open, community, effort. Anybody is welcome to jump into a SIG and begin fixing issues, critiquing design proposals and reviewing code. SIGs have regular [video meetings](https://kubernetes.io/community/) which everyone is welcome to. Each SIG has a kubernetes slack channel that you can join as well.

There is an entire SIG ([sig-contributor-experience](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience/README.md)) devoted to improving your experience as a contributor.
Contributing to Kubernetes should be easy. If you find a rough edge, let us know! Better yet, help us fix it by joining the SIG; just
show up to one of the [bi-weekly meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qf-02B7EOrItQgwXFxgqZ5qjW0mtfu5qkYIF1Hl4ZLI/edit).

#### Find a SIG that is related to your contribution

Finding the appropriate SIG for your contribution and adding a SIG label will help you ask questions in the correct place and give your contribution higher visibility and a faster community response.

For Pull Requests, the automatically assigned reviewer will add a SIG label if you haven't done so. See [Open A Pull Request](#open-a-pull-request) below.

For Issues, we are still working on a more automated workflow. Since SIGs do not directly map onto Kubernetes subrepositories, it may be difficult to find which SIG your contribution belongs in. Here is the [list of SIGs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-list.md). Determine which is most likely related to your contribution.

*Example:* if you are filing a cni issue, you should choose the [Network SIG](http://git.k8s.io/community/sig-network). Add the SIG label in a comment like so:
```
/sig network
```

Follow the link in the SIG name column to reach each SIGs README. Most SIGs will have a set of GitHub Teams with tags that can be mentioned in a comment on issues and pull requests for higher visibility. If you are not sure about the correct SIG for an issue, you can try SIG-contributor-experience [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience#github-teams), or [ask in Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/).

### File an Issue

Not ready to contribute code, but see something that needs work? While the community encourages everyone to contribute code, it is also appreciated when someone reports an issue (aka problem). Issues should be filed under the appropriate Kubernetes subrepository.
Check the [issue triage guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/./issue-triage.md) for more information. 

*Example:* a documentation issue should be opened to [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues).

Make sure to adhere to the prompted submission guidelines while opening an issue.

# Contributing

Kubernetes is open source, but many of the people working on it do so as their day job. In order to avoid forcing people to be "at work" effectively 24/7, we want to establish some semi-formal protocols around development. Hopefully, these rules make things go more smoothly. If you find that this is not the case, please complain loudly.

As a potential contributor, your changes and ideas are welcome at any hour of the day or night, weekdays, weekends, and holidays. Please do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.

Our community guiding principles on how to create great code as a big group are found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/collab.md). 

Beginner focused information can be found below in [Open a Pull Request](#open-a-pull-request) and [Code Review](#code-review).

For quick reference on contributor resources, we have a handy [contributor cheatsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/./contributor-cheatsheet.md)

### Communication

It is best to contact your [SIG](#learn-about-sigs) for issues related to the SIG's topic. Your SIG will be able to help you much more quickly than a general question would.

For general questions and troubleshooting, use the [kubernetes standard lines of communication](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication.md) and work through the [kubernetes troubleshooting guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/troubleshooting/).

## GitHub workflow

To check out code to work on, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/./github-workflow.md).

## Open a Pull Request

Pull requests are often called simply "PR".  Kubernetes generally follows the standard [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process, but there is a layer of additional kubernetes specific (and sometimes SIG specific) differences:

- [Kubernetes-specific github workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#the-testing-and-merge-workflow).

The first difference you'll see is that a bot will begin applying structured labels to your PR.

The bot may also make some helpful suggestions for commands to run in your PR to facilitate review.  These `/command` options can be entered in comments to trigger auto-labeling and notifications.  The command reference is [here](https://go.k8s.io/bot-commands).

Common new contributor PR issues are:

* not having correctly signed the CLA ahead of your first PR (see [Sign the CLA](#sign-the-cla) section)
* finding the right SIG or reviewer(s) for the PR (see [Code Review](#code-review) section) and following any SIG specific contributing guidelines
* dealing with test cases which fail on your PR, unrelated to the changes you introduce (see [Test Flakes](http://velodrome.k8s.io/dashboard/db/bigquery-metrics?orgId=1))
* Not following [scalability good practices](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/scalability-good-practices.md)

## Code Review

For a brief description of the importance of code review, please read [On Code Review](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/community-expectations.md#code-review).  There are two aspects of code review: giving and receiving.

To make it easier for your PR to receive reviews, consider the reviewers will need you to:

* follow the project [coding conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/coding-conventions.md)
* write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches which individually make easily understandable changes, and in aggregate solve a broader issue
* label PRs with appropriate SIGs and reviewers: to do this read the messages the bot sends you to guide you through the PR process

Reviewers, the people giving the review, are highly encouraged to revisit the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and must go above and beyond to promote a collaborative, respectful Kubernetes community.  When reviewing PRs from others [The Gentle Art of Patch Review](http://sage.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/) suggests an iterative series of focuses which is designed to lead new contributors to positive collaboration without inundating them initially with nuances:

* Is the idea behind the contribution sound?
* Is the contribution architected correctly?
* Is the contribution polished?

## Testing

Testing is the responsibility of all contributors and is in part owned by all sigs, but is also coordinated by [sig-testing](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-testing).

The main testing overview document is [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/testing.md).

There are three types of test in kubernetes.  The location of the test code varies with type, as does the specifics of the environment needed to successfully run the test:

* Unit: These confirm that a particular function behaves as intended.  Golang includes a native ability for unit testing via the [testing](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) package.  Unit test source code can be found adjacent to the corresponding source code within a given package.  For example: functions defined in [kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version.go](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version.go) will have unit tests in [kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version_test.go](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/util/version_test.go).  These are easily run locally by any developer on any OS.
* Integration: These tests cover interactions of package components or interactions between kubernetes components and some other non-kubernetes system resource (eg: etcd).  An example would be testing whether a piece of code can correctly store data to or retrieve data from etcd.  Integration tests are stored in [kubernetes/test/integration/](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/test/integration).  Running these can require the developer set up additional functionality on their development system.
* End-to-end ("e2e"): These are broad tests of overall kubernetes system behavior and coherence.  These are more complicated as they require a functional kubernetes cluster built from the sources to be tested.  A separate document [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/e2e-tests.md) details e2e testing and test cases themselves can be found in [kubernetes/test/e2e/](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/test/e2e).

Continuous integration will run these tests either as pre-submits on PRs, post-submits against master/release branches, or both.  The results appear on [testgrid](https://testgrid.k8s.io).

sig-testing is responsible for that official infrastructure and CI.  The associated automation is tracked in the [test-infra repo](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra).  If you're looking to run e2e tests on your own infrastructure, [kubetest](https://git.k8s.io/test-infra/kubetest) is the mechanism.

## Issues Management or Triage

Have you ever noticed the total number of [open issues](https://issues.k8s.io)? This number at any given time is typically high. Helping to manage or triage these open issues can be a great contribution to the Kubernetes project. This is also a great opportunity to learn about the various areas of the project. Refer to the [Kubernetes Issue Triage Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel/issues.md) for more information.

# Community

If you haven't noticed by now, we have a large, lively, and friendly open-source community.
