This folder will be used for all mentoring initiatives for Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes Pilots

We understand that everyone has different learning styles and we want to support as many of those as possible. Mentoring is vital to the growth of an individual and organization of every kind. For Kubernetes, the larger the project becomes, it's necessary to keep a continuous pipeline of quality contributors.

*What's a Pilot?*  
A pilot is a Kubernetes mentor helping new and current members navigate the seas of our repos.

## Current mentoring activities:
All are currently in an incubation phase. Please reach out to Paris Pittman (parispittman@google.com or Paris on Kubernetes slack channel) for more information on how to get involved.
