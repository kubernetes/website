<!-- overview -->

This section lists the different ways to set up and run Kubernetes.
When you install Kubernetes, choose an installation type based on: ease of maintenance, security,
control, available resources, and expertise required to operate and manage a cluster.

You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, cloud, on-prem datacenter, or choose a managed Kubernetes cluster. There are also custom solutions across a wide range of cloud providers, or bare metal environments.

## Learning environment

If you're learning Kubernetes, use the tools supported by the Kubernetes community, or tools in the ecosystem to set up a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine.

## Production environment

When evaluating a solution for a production environment, consider which aspects of operating a Kubernetes cluster (or _abstractions_) you want to manage yourself or offload to a provider.

[Kubernetes Partners](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#conformance) includes a list of [Certified Kubernetes](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/#certified-kubernetes) providers.
