<!-- overview -->
{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.6" state="stable" >}}
To run containers in Pods, Kubernetes uses a container runtime. Here are
the installation instructions for various runtimes.



<!-- body -->


{{< caution >}}
A flaw was found in the way runc handled system file descriptors when running containers.
A malicious container could use this flaw to overwrite contents of the runc binary and
consequently run arbitrary commands on the container host system.

Please refer to [CVE-2019-5736](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-5736) for more
information about the issue.
{{< /caution >}}

### Applicability

{{< note >}}
This document is written for users installing CRI onto Linux. For other operating
systems, look for documentation specific to your platform.
{{< /note >}}

You should execute all the commands in this guide as `root`. For example, prefix commands
with `sudo `, or become `root` and run the commands as that user.

### Cgroup drivers

When systemd is chosen as the init system for a Linux distribution, the init process generates
and consumes a root control group (`cgroup`) and acts as a cgroup manager. Systemd has a tight
integration with cgroups and will allocate cgroups per process. It's possible to configure your
container runtime and the kubelet to use `cgroupfs`. Using `cgroupfs` alongside systemd means
that there will be two different cgroup managers.

Control groups are used to constrain resources that are allocated to processes.
A single cgroup manager will simplify the view of what resources are being allocated
and will by default have a more consistent view of the available and in-use resources. When we have
two managers we end up with two views of those resources. We have seen cases in the field
where nodes that are configured to use `cgroupfs` for the kubelet and Docker, and `systemd`
for the rest of the processes running on the node becomes unstable under resource pressure.

Changing the settings such that your container runtime and kubelet use `systemd` as the cgroup driver
stabilized the system. Please note the `native.cgroupdriver=systemd` option in the Docker setup below.

{{< caution >}}
Changing the cgroup driver of a Node that has joined a cluster is highly unrecommended.
If the kubelet has created Pods using the semantics of one cgroup driver, changing the container
runtime to another cgroup driver can cause errors when trying to re-create the PodSandbox
for such existing Pods. Restarting the kubelet may not solve such errors. The recommendation
is to drain the Node from its workloads, remove it from the cluster and re-join it.

## Docker

On each of your machines, install Docker.
Version 19.03.11 is recommended, but 1.13.1, 17.03, 17.06, 17.09, 18.06 and 18.09 are known to work as well.
Keep track of the latest verified Docker version in the Kubernetes release notes.

Use the following commands to install Docker on your system:

{{< tabs name="tab-cri-docker-installation" >}}
{{% tab name="Ubuntu 16.04+" %}}

```shell

If you want the docker service to start on boot, run the following command:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Refer to the [official Docker installation guides](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
for more information.

## CRI-O

This section contains the necessary steps to install `CRI-O` as CRI runtime.

Use the following commands to install CRI-O on your system:

{{< note >}}
The CRI-O major and minor versions must match the Kubernetes major and minor versions.
For more information, see the [CRI-O compatiblity matrix](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o).
{{< /note >}}

### Prerequisites

```shell
modprobe overlay
modprobe br_netfilter

# Set up required sysctl params, these persist across reboots.
cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-kubernetes-cri.conf <<EOF
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
EOF

sysctl --system
```

{{< tabs name="tab-cri-cri-o-installation" >}}
{{% tab name="Debian" %}}

To install CRI-O on the following operating systems, set the environment variable $OS to the appropriate field in the following table:

| Operating system | $OS               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Debian Unstable  | `Debian_Unstable` |
| Debian Testing   | `Debian_Testing`  |

<br />
Then, set `$VERSION` to the CRI-O version that matches your Kubernetes version.
For instance, if you want to install CRI-O 1.18, set `VERSION=1.18`.
You can pin your installation to a specific release.
To install version 1.18.3, set `VERSION=1.18:1.18.3`.
<br />

Then run
```shell
echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list
echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -
curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -

apt-get update
apt-get install cri-o cri-o-runc
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Ubuntu" %}}

To install on the following operating systems, set the environment variable $OS to the appropriate field in the following table:

| Ubuntu 19.10     | `xUbuntu_19.10`   |
| Ubuntu 19.04     | `xUbuntu_19.04`   |
| Ubuntu 18.04     | `xUbuntu_18.04`   |

<br />
Then, set `$VERSION` to the CRI-O version that matches your Kubernetes version.
For instance, if you want to install CRI-O 1.18, set `VERSION=1.18`.
You can pin your installation to a specific release.
To install version 1.18.3, set `VERSION=1.18:1.18.3`.
<br />

Then run
```shell
echo "deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.list
echo "deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable:/cri-o:/$VERSION/$OS/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.list

curl -L https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/Release.key | apt-key add -

{{% tab name="CentOS" %}}

To install on the following operating systems, set the environment variable $OS to the appropriate field in the following table:

| Operating system | $OS               |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Centos 8         | `CentOS_8`        |
| Centos 8 Stream  | `CentOS_8_Stream` |
| Centos 7         | `CentOS_7`        |

<br />
Then, set `$VERSION` to the CRI-O version that matches your Kubernetes version.
For instance, if you want to install CRI-O 1.18, set `VERSION=1.18`.
You can pin your installation to a specific release.
To install version 1.18.3, set `VERSION=1.18:1.18.3`.
<br />

Then run
```shell
curl -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/kubic:/libcontainers:/stable/$OS/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable.repo
curl -L -o /etc/yum.repos.d/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.repo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION/$OS/devel:kubic:libcontainers:stable:cri-o:$VERSION.repo
yum install cri-o
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="openSUSE Tumbleweed" %}}

```shell
sudo zypper install cri-o
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Fedora" %}}

Set `$VERSION` to the CRI-O version that matches your Kubernetes version.
For instance, if you want to install CRI-O 1.18, `VERSION=1.18`                                                                                                                                                                               
You can find available versions with:
```shell
dnf module list cri-o
```
CRI-O does not support pinning to specific releases on Fedora.

Then run
```shell
dnf module enable cri-o:$VERSION
dnf install cri-o
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

### Start CRI-O

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start crio
```

Refer to the [CRI-O installation guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o#getting-started)
for more information.

### systemd

To use the `systemd` cgroup driver, set `plugins.cri.systemd_cgroup = true` in `/etc/containerd/config.toml`.
When using kubeadm, manually configure the
[cgroup driver for kubelet](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#configure-cgroup-driver-used-by-kubelet-on-control-plane-node)
