<!-- overview -->

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/master/logos/stacked/color/kubeadm-stacked-color.png" align="right" width="150px">Using `kubeadm`, you can create a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. In fact, you can use `kubeadm` to set up a cluster that will pass the [Kubernetes Conformance tests](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/10/software-conformance-certification).
`kubeadm` also supports other cluster
lifecycle functions, such as [bootstrap tokens](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/bootstrap-tokens/) and cluster upgrades.

The `kubeadm` tool is good if you need:

- A simple way for you to try out Kubernetes, possibly for the first time.
- A way for existing users to automate setting up a cluster and test their application.
- A building block in other ecosystem and/or installer tools with a larger
  scope.

You can install and use `kubeadm` on various machines: your laptop, a set
of cloud servers, a Raspberry Pi, and more. Whether you're deploying into the
cloud or on-premises, you can integrate `kubeadm` into provisioning systems such
as Ansible or Terraform.



## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}


To follow this guide, you need:

- One or more machines running a deb/rpm-compatible Linux OS; for example: Ubuntu or CentOS.
- 2 GiB or more of RAM per machine--any less leaves little room for your
   apps.
- At least 2 CPUs on the machine that you use as a control-plane node.
- Full network connectivity among all machines in the cluster. You can use either a
  public or a private network.


You also need to use a version of `kubeadm` that can deploy the version
of Kubernetes that you want to use in your new cluster.

[Kubernetes' version and version skew support policy](/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions) applies to `kubeadm` as well as to Kubernetes overall.
Check that policy to learn about what versions of Kubernetes and `kubeadm`
are supported. This page is written for Kubernetes {{< param "version" >}}.

The `kubeadm` tool's overall feature state is General Availability (GA). Some sub-features are
still under active development. The implementation of creating the cluster may change
slightly as the tool evolves, but the overall implementation should be pretty stable.

{{< note >}}
Any commands under `kubeadm alpha` are, by definition, supported on an alpha level.

<!-- steps -->

## Objectives

* Install a single control-plane Kubernetes cluster
* Install a Pod network on the cluster so that your Pods can
  talk to each other

## Instructions

### Installing kubeadm on your hosts

See ["Installing kubeadm"](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/).

{{< note >}}
If you have already installed kubeadm, run `apt-get update &&
apt-get upgrade` or `yum update` to get the latest version of kubeadm.

When you upgrade, the kubelet restarts every few seconds as it waits in a crashloop for
kubeadm to tell it what to do. This crashloop is expected and normal.
After you initialize your control-plane, the kubelet runs normally.
{{< /note >}}

### Initializing your control-plane node

The control-plane node is the machine where the control plane components run, including
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="etcd" >}} (the cluster database) and the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="API Server" term_id="kube-apiserver" >}}
(which the {{< glossary_tooltip text="kubectl" term_id="kubectl" >}} command line tool
communicates with).

1. (Recommended) If you have plans to upgrade this single control-plane `kubeadm` cluster
to high availability you should specify the `--control-plane-endpoint` to set the shared endpoint
for all control-plane nodes. Such an endpoint can be either a DNS name or an IP address of a load-balancer.
1. Choose a Pod network add-on, and verify whether it requires any arguments to
be passed to `kubeadm init`. Depending on which
third-party provider you choose, you might need to set the `--pod-network-cidr` to
a provider-specific value. See [Installing a Pod network add-on](#pod-network).
1. (Optional) Since version 1.14, `kubeadm` tries to detect the container runtime on Linux
by using a list of well known domain socket paths. To use different container runtime or
if there are more than one installed on the provisioned node, specify the `--cri-socket`
argument to `kubeadm init`. See [Installing runtime](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-runtime).
1. (Optional) Unless otherwise specified, `kubeadm` uses the network interface associated
with the default gateway to set the advertise address for this particular control-plane node's API server.
To use a different network interface, specify the `--apiserver-advertise-address=<ip-address>` argument
to `kubeadm init`. To deploy an IPv6 Kubernetes cluster using IPv6 addressing, you
must specify an IPv6 address, for example `--apiserver-advertise-address=fd00::101`
1. (Optional) Run `kubeadm config images pull` prior to `kubeadm init` to verify
connectivity to the gcr.io container image registry.

To initialize the control-plane node run:

```bash
kubeadm init <args>
```

### Considerations about apiserver-advertise-address and ControlPlaneEndpoint

While `--apiserver-advertise-address` can be used to set the advertise address for this particular
control-plane node's API server, `--control-plane-endpoint` can be used to set the shared endpoint
for all control-plane nodes.

`--control-plane-endpoint` allows both IP addresses and DNS names that can map to IP addresses.
Please contact your network administrator to evaluate possible solutions with respect to such mapping.

Here is an example mapping:

```
192.168.0.102 cluster-endpoint
```

Where `192.168.0.102` is the IP address of this node and `cluster-endpoint` is a custom DNS name that maps to this IP.
This will allow you to pass `--control-plane-endpoint=cluster-endpoint` to `kubeadm init` and pass the same DNS name to
`kubeadm join`. Later you can modify `cluster-endpoint` to point to the address of your load-balancer in an
high availability scenario.

Turning a single control plane cluster created without `--control-plane-endpoint` into a highly available cluster
is not supported by kubeadm.

### More information

For more information about `kubeadm init` arguments, see the [kubeadm reference guide](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/).

To configure `kubeadm init` with a configuration file see [Using kubeadm init with a configuration file](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-init/#config-file).

To customize control plane components, including optional IPv6 assignment to liveness probe for control plane components and etcd server, provide extra arguments to each component as documented in [custom arguments](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/control-plane-flags/).

To run `kubeadm init` again, you must first [tear down the cluster](#tear-down).

If you join a node with a different architecture to your cluster, make sure that your deployed DaemonSets
have container image support for this architecture.

`kubeadm init` first runs a series of prechecks to ensure that the machine
is ready to run Kubernetes. These prechecks expose warnings and exit on errors. `kubeadm init`
then downloads and installs the cluster control plane components. This may take several minutes.
After it finishes you should see:

```none
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a Pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  /docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

To make kubectl work for your non-root user, run these commands, which are
also part of the `kubeadm init` output:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Alternatively, if you are the `root` user, you can run:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

{{< warning >}}
Kubeadm signs the certificate in the `admin.conf` to have `Subject: O = system:masters, CN = kubernetes-admin`.
`system:masters` is a break-glass, super user group that bypasses the authorization layer (e.g. RBAC).
Do not share the `admin.conf` file with anyone and instead grant users custom permissions by generating
them a kubeconfig file using the `kubeadm kubeconfig user` command.
{{< /warning >}}

Make a record of the `kubeadm join` command that `kubeadm init` outputs. You
need this command to [join nodes to your cluster](#join-nodes).

The token is used for mutual authentication between the control-plane node and the joining
nodes. The token included here is secret. Keep it safe, because anyone with this
token can add authenticated nodes to your cluster. These tokens can be listed,
created, and deleted with the `kubeadm token` command. See the
[kubeadm reference guide](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-token/).

### Installing a Pod network add-on {#pod-network}

{{< caution >}}
This section contains important information about networking setup and
deployment order.
Read all of this advice carefully before proceeding.

**You must deploy a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Container Network Interface" term_id="cni" >}}
(CNI) based Pod network add-on so that your Pods can communicate with each other.
Cluster DNS (CoreDNS) will not start up before a network is installed.**

- Take care that your Pod network must not overlap with any of the host
  networks: you are likely to see problems if there is any overlap.
  (If you find a collision between your network plugin's preferred Pod
  network and some of your host networks, you should think of a suitable
  CIDR block to use instead, then use that during `kubeadm init` with
  `--pod-network-cidr` and as a replacement in your network plugin's YAML).

- By default, `kubeadm` sets up your cluster to use and enforce use of
  [RBAC](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) (role based access
  control).
  Make sure that your Pod network plugin supports RBAC, and so do any manifests
  that you use to deploy it.

- If you want to use IPv6--either dual-stack, or single-stack IPv6 only
  networking--for your cluster, make sure that your Pod network plugin
  supports IPv6.
  IPv6 support was added to CNI in [v0.6.0](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

{{< /caution >}}

{{< note >}}
Kubeadm should be CNI agnostic and the validation of CNI providers is out of the scope of our current e2e testing.
If you find an issue related to a CNI plugin you should log a ticket in its respective issue
tracker instead of the kubeadm or kubernetes issue trackers.
{{< /note >}}

Several external projects provide Kubernetes Pod networks using CNI, some of which also
support [Network Policy](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/).

See a list of add-ons that implement the
[Kubernetes networking model](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-implement-the-kubernetes-networking-model).

You can install a Pod network add-on with the following command on the
control-plane node or a node that has the kubeconfig credentials:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <add-on.yaml>
```

You can install only one Pod network per cluster.

Once a Pod network has been installed, you can confirm that it is working by
checking that the CoreDNS Pod is `Running` in the output of `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`.
And once the CoreDNS Pod is up and running, you can continue by joining your nodes.

If your network is not working or CoreDNS is not in the `Running` state, check out the
[troubleshooting guide](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/troubleshooting-kubeadm/)
for `kubeadm`.

### Control plane node isolation

By default, your cluster will not schedule Pods on the control-plane node for security
reasons. If you want to be able to schedule Pods on the control-plane node, for example for a
single-machine Kubernetes cluster for development, run:

```bash
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
```

With output looking something like:

```
node "test-01" untainted
taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" not found
taint "node-role.kubernetes.io/master:" not found
```

This will remove the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` taint from any nodes that
have it, including the control-plane node, meaning that the scheduler will then be able
to schedule Pods everywhere.

### Joining your nodes {#join-nodes}

The nodes are where your workloads (containers and Pods, etc) run. To add new nodes to your cluster do the following for each machine:

* SSH to the machine
* Become root (e.g. `sudo su -`)
* Run the command that was output by `kubeadm init`. For example:

```bash
kubeadm join --token <token> <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
```

If you do not have the token, you can get it by running the following command on the control-plane node:

```bash
kubeadm token list
```

The output is similar to this:

```console
TOKEN                    TTL  EXPIRES              USAGES           DESCRIPTION            EXTRA GROUPS
8ewj1p.9r9hcjoqgajrj4gi  23h  2018-06-12T02:51:28Z authentication,  The default bootstrap  system:
                                                   signing          token generated by     bootstrappers:
                                                                    'kubeadm init'.        kubeadm:
                                                                                           default-node-token
```

By default, tokens expire after 24 hours. If you are joining a node to the cluster after the current token has expired,
you can create a new token by running the following command on the control-plane node:

```bash
kubeadm token create
```

The output is similar to this:

```console
5didvk.d09sbcov8ph2amjw
```

If you don't have the value of `--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash`, you can get it by running the following command chain on the control-plane node:

```bash
openssl x509 -pubkey -in /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
   openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'
```

The output is similar to:

```console
8cb2de97839780a412b93877f8507ad6c94f73add17d5d7058e91741c9d5ec78
```

{{< note >}}
To specify an IPv6 tuple for `<control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port>`, IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets, for example: `[fd00::101]:2073`.
{{< /note >}}

The output should look something like:

```
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks

... (log output of join workflow) ...

Node join complete:
* Certificate signing request sent to control-plane and response
  received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on control-plane to see this machine join.
```

A few seconds later, you should notice this node in the output from `kubectl get
nodes` when run on the control-plane node.

### (Optional) Controlling your cluster from machines other than the control-plane node

In order to get a kubectl on some other computer (e.g. laptop) to talk to your
cluster, you need to copy the administrator kubeconfig file from your control-plane node
to your workstation like this:

```bash
scp root@<control-plane-host>:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf .
kubectl --kubeconfig ./admin.conf get nodes
```

{{< note >}}
The example above assumes SSH access is enabled for root. If that is not the
case, you can copy the `admin.conf` file to be accessible by some other user
and `scp` using that other user instead.

The `admin.conf` file gives the user _superuser_ privileges over the cluster.
This file should be used sparingly. For normal users, it's recommended to
generate an unique credential to which you grant privileges. You can do
this with the `kubeadm alpha kubeconfig user --client-name <CN>`
command. That command will print out a KubeConfig file to STDOUT which you
should save to a file and distribute to your user. After that, grant
privileges by using `kubectl create (cluster)rolebinding`.
{{< /note >}}

### (Optional) Proxying API Server to localhost

If you want to connect to the API Server from outside the cluster you can use
`kubectl proxy`:

```bash
scp root@<control-plane-host>:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf .
kubectl --kubeconfig ./admin.conf proxy
```

You can now access the API Server locally at `http://localhost:8001/api/v1`

## Clean up {#tear-down}

If you used disposable servers for your cluster, for testing, you can
switch those off and do no further clean up. You can use
`kubectl config delete-cluster` to delete your local references to the
cluster.

However, if you want to deprovision your cluster more cleanly, you should
first [drain the node](/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#drain)
and make sure that the node is empty, then deconfigure the node.

### Remove the node

Talking to the control-plane node with the appropriate credentials, run:

```bash
kubectl drain <node name> --delete-local-data --force --ignore-daemonsets
```

Before removing the node, reset the state installed by `kubeadm`:

```bash
kubeadm reset
```

The reset process does not reset or clean up iptables rules or IPVS tables. If you wish to reset iptables, you must do so manually:

```bash
iptables -F && iptables -t nat -F && iptables -t mangle -F && iptables -X
```

If you want to reset the IPVS tables, you must run the following command:

```bash
ipvsadm -C
```

Now remove the node:
```bash
kubectl delete node <node name>
```

If you wish to start over, run `kubeadm init` or `kubeadm join` with the
appropriate arguments.

### Clean up the control plane

You can use `kubeadm reset` on the control plane host to trigger a best-effort
clean up.

See the [`kubeadm reset`](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-reset/)
reference documentation for more information about this subcommand and its
options.

## Version skew policy {#version-skew-policy}

The `kubeadm` tool of version v{{< skew latestVersion >}} may deploy clusters with a control plane of version v{{< skew latestVersion >}} or v{{< skew prevMinorVersion >}}.
`kubeadm` v{{< skew latestVersion >}} can also upgrade an existing kubeadm-created cluster of version v{{< skew prevMinorVersion >}}.

Due to that we can't see into the future, kubeadm CLI v{{< skew latestVersion >}} may or may not be able to deploy v{{< skew nextMinorVersion >}} clusters.

These resources provide more information on supported version skew between kubelets and the control plane, and other Kubernetes components:

* Kubernetes [version and version-skew policy](/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/)
* Kubeadm-specific [installation guide](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-kubeadm-kubelet-and-kubectl)

## Limitations {#limitations}

### Cluster resilience {#resilience}

The cluster created here has a single control-plane node, with a single etcd database
running on it. This means that if the control-plane node fails, your cluster may lose
data and may need to be recreated from scratch.

Workarounds:

* Regularly [back up etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/admin_guide.html). The
  etcd data directory configured by kubeadm is at `/var/lib/etcd` on the control-plane node.

* Use multiple control-plane nodes. You can read
  [Options for Highly Available topology](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/) to pick a cluster
  topology that provides [high-availability](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/).

### Platform compatibility {#multi-platform}

kubeadm deb/rpm packages and binaries are built for amd64, arm (32-bit), arm64, ppc64le, and s390x
following the [multi-platform
proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/multi-platform.md).

Multiplatform container images for the control plane and addons are also supported since v1.12.

Only some of the network providers offer solutions for all platforms. Please consult the list of
network providers above or the documentation from each provider to figure out whether the provider
supports your chosen platform.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If you are running into difficulties with kubeadm, please consult our [troubleshooting docs](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/troubleshooting-kubeadm/).
