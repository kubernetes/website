title: Windows containers in Kubernetes
content_type: concept
weight: 65
---

<!-- overview -->

Windows applications constitute a large portion of the services and applications that
run in many organizations. [Windows containers](https://aka.ms/windowscontainers)
provide a way to encapsulate processes and package dependencies, making it easier
to use DevOps practices and follow cloud native patterns for Windows applications.

Organizations with investments in Windows-based applications and Linux-based
applications don't have to look for separate orchestrators to manage their workloads,
leading to increased operational efficiencies across their deployments, regardless
of operating system.

<!-- body -->

## Windows nodes in Kubernetes

To enable the orchestration of Windows containers in Kubernetes, include Windows nodes
in your existing Linux cluster. Scheduling Windows containers in
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}} on Kubernetes is similar to
scheduling Linux-based containers.

In order to run Windows containers, your Kubernetes cluster must include
multiple operating systems.
While you can only run the {{< glossary_tooltip text="control plane" term_id="control-plane" >}} on Linux, you can deploy worker nodes running either Windows or Linux depending on your workload needs.

Windows {{< glossary_tooltip text="nodes" term_id="node" >}} are
[supported](#windows-os-version-support) provided that the operating system is
Windows Server 2019.

This document uses the term *Windows containers* to mean Windows containers with
process isolation. Kubernetes does not support running Windows containers with
[Hyper-V isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container).

## Resource management

On Linux nodes, {{< glossary_tooltip text="cgroups" term_id="cgroup" >}} are used
as a pod boundary for resource control. Containers are created within that boundary
for network, process and file system isolation. The Linux cgroup APIs can be used
to gather CPU, I/O, and memory use statistics.

In contrast, Windows uses a _job object_ per container with a system namespace filter
to contain all processes in a container and provide logical isolation from the
host.
(Job objects are a Windows process isolation mechanism and are different from
what Kubernetes refers to as a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="job" text="Job" >}}).

There is no way to run a Windows container without the namespace filtering in
place. This means that system privileges cannot be asserted in the context of the
host, and thus privileged containers are not available on Windows.
Containers cannot assume an identity from the host because the Security Account Manager
(SAM) is separate.

#### Memory reservations {#resource-management-memory}

Windows does not have an out-of-memory process killer as Linux does. Windows always
treats all user-mode memory allocations as virtual, and pagefiles are mandatory
(on Linux, the kubelet will by default not start with swap space enabled).

Windows nodes do not overcommit memory for processes running in containers. The
net effect is that Windows won't reach out of memory conditions the same way Linux
does, and processes page to disk instead of being subject to out of memory (OOM)
termination. If memory is over-provisioned and all physical memory is exhausted,
then paging can slow down performance.

You can place bounds on memory use for workloads using the kubelet
parameters `--kubelet-reserve` and/or `--system-reserve`; these account
for memory usage on the node (outside of containers), and reduce
[NodeAllocatable](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable)).
As you deploy workloads, set resource limits on containers. This also subtracts from
`NodeAllocatable` and prevents the scheduler from adding more pods once a node is full.

{{< note >}}
When you set memory resource limits for Windows containers, you should either set a
limit and leave the memory request unspecified, or set the request equal to the limit.
{{< /note >}}

On Windows, good practice to avoid over-provisioning is to configure the kubelet
with a system reserved memory of at least 2GiB to account for Windows, Kubernetes
and container runtime overheads.

#### CPU reservations {#resource-management-cpu}

To account for CPU use by the operating system, the container runtime, and by
Kubernetes host processes such as the kubelet, you can (and should) reserve a
percentage of total CPU. You should determine this CPU reservation taking account of
to the number of CPU cores available on the node. To decide on the CPU percentage to
reserve, identify the maximum pod density for each node and monitor the CPU usage of
the system services running there, then choose a value that meets your workload needs.

You can place bounds on CPU usage for workloads using the
kubelet parameters `--kubelet-reserve` and/or `--system-reserve` to
account for CPU usage on the node (outside of containers).
This reduces `NodeAllocatable`.
The cluster-wide scheduler then takes this reservation into account when determining
pod placement.

On Windows, the kubelet supports a command-line flag to set the priority of the
kubelet process: `--windows-priorityclass`. This flag allows the kubelet process to get
more CPU time slices when compared to other processes running on the Windows host.
More information on the allowable values and their meaning is available at
[Windows Priority Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities#priority-class).
To ensure that running Pods do not starve the kubelet of CPU cycles, set this flag to `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS` or above.

## Compatibility and limitations {#limitations}

Some node features are only available if you use a specific
[container runtime](#container-runtime); others are not available on Windows nodes,
including:

* HugePages: not supported for Windows containers
* Privileged containers: not supported for Windows containers
* TerminationGracePeriod: not implemented

Not all features of shared namespaces are supported. See [API compatibility](#api)
for more details.

See [Windows OS version compatibility](#windows-os-version-support) for details on
the Windows versions that Kubernetes is tested against.

From an API and kubectl perspective, Windows containers behave in much the same
way as Linux-based containers. However, there are some notable differences in key
functionality which are outlined in this section.

### Comparison with Linux {#compatibility-linux-similarities}

Key Kubernetes elements work the same way in Windows as they do in Linux. This
section refers to several key workload enablers and how they map to Windows.

* [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)

  A Pod is the basic building block of Kubernetes–the smallest and simplest unit in
  the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. You may not deploy Windows and
  Linux containers in the same Pod. All containers in a Pod are scheduled onto a single
  Node where each Node represents a specific platform and architecture. The following
  Pod capabilities, properties and events are supported with Windows containers:

  * Single or multiple containers per Pod with process isolation and volume sharing
  * Pod `status` fields
  * Readiness and Liveness probes
  * postStart & preStop container lifecycle events
  * ConfigMap, Secrets: as environment variables or volumes
  * `emptyDir` volumes
  * Named pipe host mounts
  * Resource limits
* [Workload resources](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/) including:
  * ReplicaSet
  * Deployments
  * StatefulSets
  * DaemonSet
  * Job
  * CronJob
  * ReplicationController
* {{< glossary_tooltip text="Services" term_id="service" >}}
  See [Load balancing and Services](#load-balancing-and-services) for more details.

Pods, workload resources, and Services are critical elements to managing Windows
workloads on Kubernetes. However, on their own they are not enough to enable
the proper lifecycle management of Windows workloads in a dynamic cloud native
environment. Kubernetes also supports:

* `kubectl exec`
* Pod and container metrics
* {{< glossary_tooltip text="Horizontal pod autoscaling" term_id="horizontal-pod-autoscaler" >}}
* {{< glossary_tooltip text="Resource quotas" term_id="resource-quota" >}}
* Scheduler preemption


### Networking on Windows nodes {#compatibility-networking}

Networking for Windows containers is exposed through
[CNI plugins](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/).
Windows containers function similarly to virtual machines in regards to
networking. Each container has a virtual network adapter (vNIC) which is connected
to a Hyper-V virtual switch (vSwitch). The Host Networking Service (HNS) and the
Host Compute Service (HCS) work together to create containers and attach container
vNICs to networks. HCS is responsible for the management of containers whereas HNS
is responsible for the management of networking resources such as:

* Virtual networks (including creation of vSwitches)
* Endpoints / vNICs
* Namespaces
* Policies including packet encapsulations, load-balancing rules, ACLs, and NAT rules.

#### Container networking {#networking}

The Windows HNS and vSwitch implement namespacing and can
create virtual NICs as needed for a pod or container. However, many configurations such
as DNS, routes, and metrics are stored in the Windows registry database rather than as
files inside `/etc`, which is how Linux stores those configurations. The Windows registry for the container
is separate from that of the host, so concepts like mapping `/etc/resolv.conf` from
the host into a container don't have the same effect they would on Linux. These must
be configured using Windows APIs run in the context of that container. Therefore
CNI implementations need to call the HNS instead of relying on file mappings to pass
network details into the pod or container.

The following networking functionality is _not_ supported on Windows nodes:

* Host networking mode
* Local NodePort access from the node itself (works for other nodes or external clients)
* More than 64 backend pods (or unique destination addresses) for a single Service
* IPv6 communication between Windows pods connected to overlay networks
* Local Traffic Policy in non-DSR mode
* Outbound communication using the ICMP protocol via the `win-overlay`, `win-bridge`, or using the Azure-CNI plugin.\
  Specifically, the Windows data plane ([VFP](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/azure-virtual-filtering-platform/)) doesn't support ICMP packet transpositions, and this means:
  * ICMP packets directed to destinations within the same network (such as pod to pod communication via ping) work as expected and without any limitations;
  * TCP/UDP packets work as expected and without any limitations;
  * ICMP packets directed to pass through a remote network (e.g. pod to external internet communication via ping) cannot be transposed and thus will not be routed back to their source;
  * Since TCP/UDP packets can still be transposed, you can substitute `ping <destination>` with `curl <destination>` to get some debugging insight into connectivity with the outside world.

Overlay networking support in kube-proxy is a beta feature. In addition, it requires
[KB4482887](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4482887/windows-10-update-kb4482887)
to be installed on Windows Server 2019.

#### Network modes

Windows supports five different networking drivers/modes: L2bridge, L2tunnel,
Overlay (beta), Transparent, and NAT. In a heterogeneous cluster with Windows and Linux
worker nodes, you need to select a networking solution that is compatible on both
Windows and Linux. The following out-of-tree plugins are supported on Windows,
with recommendations on when to use each CNI:

| Network Driver | Description | Container Packet Modifications | Network Plugins | Network Plugin Characteristics |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| L2bridge       | Containers are attached to an external vSwitch. Containers are attached to the underlay network, although the physical network doesn't need to learn the container MACs because they are rewritten on ingress/egress. | MAC is rewritten to host MAC, IP may be rewritten to host IP using HNS OutboundNAT policy. | [win-bridge](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/windows/win-bridge), [Azure-CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), Flannel host-gateway uses win-bridge | win-bridge uses L2bridge network mode, connects containers to the underlay of hosts, offering best performance. Requires user-defined routes (UDR) for inter-node connectivity. |
| L2Tunnel | This is a special case of l2bridge, but only used on Azure. All packets are sent to the virtualization host where SDN policy is applied. | MAC rewritten, IP visible on the underlay network | [Azure-CNI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md) | Azure-CNI allows integration of containers with Azure vNET, and allows them to leverage the set of capabilities that [Azure Virtual Network provides](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-network/). For example, securely connect to Azure services or use Azure NSGs. See [azure-cni for some examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-network#azure-cni-advanced-networking) |
| Overlay (Overlay networking for Windows in Kubernetes is in *alpha* stage) | Containers are given a vNIC connected to an external vSwitch. Each overlay network gets its own IP subnet, defined by a custom IP prefix.The overlay network driver uses VXLAN encapsulation. | Encapsulated with an outer header. | [Win-overlay](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/windows/win-overlay), Flannel VXLAN (uses win-overlay) | win-overlay should be used when virtual container networks are desired to be isolated from underlay of hosts (e.g. for security reasons). Allows for IPs to be re-used for different overlay networks (which have different VNID tags)  if you are restricted on IPs in your datacenter.  This option requires [KB4489899](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4489899) on Windows Server 2019. |
| Transparent (special use case for [ovn-kubernetes](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes)) | Requires an external vSwitch. Containers are attached to an external vSwitch which enables intra-pod communication via logical networks (logical switches and routers). | Packet is encapsulated either via [GENEVE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-gross-geneve/) or [STT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davie-stt/) tunneling to reach pods which are not on the same host.  <br/> Packets are forwarded or dropped via the tunnel metadata information supplied by the ovn network controller. <br/> NAT is done for north-south communication. | [ovn-kubernetes](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes) | [Deploy via ansible](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes/tree/master/contrib). Distributed ACLs can be applied via Kubernetes policies. IPAM support. Load-balancing can be achieved without kube-proxy. NATing is done without using iptables/netsh. |
| NAT (*not used in Kubernetes*) | Containers are given a vNIC connected to an internal vSwitch. DNS/DHCP is provided using an internal component called [WinNAT](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/virtualization/2016/05/25/windows-nat-winnat-capabilities-and-limitations/) | MAC and IP is rewritten to host MAC/IP. | [nat](https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-container-networking/tree/master/plugins/nat) | Included here for completeness |

As outlined above, the [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel)
CNI [meta plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/meta/flannel)
is also [supported](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/meta/flannel#windows-support-experimental) on Windows via the
[VXLAN network backend](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md#vxlan) (**alpha support** ; delegates to win-overlay)
and [host-gateway network backend](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md#host-gw) (stable support; delegates to win-bridge).

This plugin supports delegating to one of the reference CNI plugins (win-overlay,
win-bridge), to work in conjunction with Flannel daemon on Windows (Flanneld) for
automatic node subnet lease assignment and HNS network creation. This plugin reads
in its own configuration file (cni.conf), and aggregates it with the environment
variables from the FlannelD generated subnet.env file. It then delegates to one of
the reference CNI plugins for network plumbing, and sends the correct configuration
containing the node-assigned subnet to the IPAM plugin (for example: `host-local`).

For Node, Pod, and Service objects, the following network flows are supported for
TCP/UDP traffic:

* Pod → Pod (IP)
* Pod → Pod (Name)
* Pod → Service (Cluster IP)
* Pod → Service (PQDN, but only if there are no ".")
* Pod → Service (FQDN)
* Pod → external (IP)
* Pod → external (DNS)
* Node → Pod
* Pod → Node

#### CNI plugin limitations

* Windows reference network plugins win-bridge and win-overlay do not implement
  [CNI spec](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md) v0.4.0,
  due to a missing `CHECK` implementation.
* The Flannel VXLAN CNI plugin has the following limitations on Windows:

1. Node-pod connectivity isn't possible by design. It's only possible for local pods with Flannel v0.12.0 (or higher).
2. Flannel is restricted to using VNI 4096 and UDP port 4789. See the official
   [Flannel VXLAN](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md#vxlan)
   backend docs for more details on these parameters.

#### IP address management (IPAM) {#ipam}

The following IPAM options are supported on Windows:

* [host-local](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/ipam/host-local)
* HNS IPAM (Inbox platform IPAM, this is a fallback when no IPAM is set)
* [azure-vnet-ipam](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/ipam.md) (for azure-cni only)

#### Load balancing and Services

A Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="Service" term_id="service" >}} is an abstraction
that defines a logical set of Pods and a means to access them over a network.
In a cluster that includes Windows nodes, you can use the following types of Service:

  * `NodePort`
  * `ClusterIP`
  * `LoadBalancer`
  * `ExternalName`

Windows container networking differs in some important ways from Linux networking.
The [Microsoft documentation for Windows Container Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/container-networking/architecture) provides
additional details and background.

On Windows, you can use the following settings to configure Services and load
balancing behavior:

{{< table caption="Windows Service Settings" >}}
| Feature | Description | Supported Kubernetes version  | Supported Windows OS build | How to enable |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Session affinity | Ensures that connections from a particular client are passed to the same Pod each time. | v1.20+ | [Windows Server vNext Insider Preview Build 19551](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/01/28/announcing-windows-server-vnext-insider-preview-build-19551/) (or higher) | Set `service.spec.sessionAffinity` to "ClientIP" |
| Direct Server Return (DSR) | Load balancing mode where the IP address fixups and the LBNAT occurs at the container vSwitch port directly; service traffic arrives with the source IP set as the originating pod IP. | v1.20+ | Windows Server 2019 | Set the following flags in kube-proxy: `--feature-gates="WinDSR=true" --enable-dsr=true` |
| Preserve-Destination | Skips DNAT of service traffic, thereby preserving the virtual IP of the target service in packets reaching the backend Pod. Also disables node-node forwarding. | v1.20+ | Windows Server, version 1903 (or higher) | Set `"preserve-destination": "true"` in service annotations and enable DSR in kube-proxy. |
| IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking | Native IPv4-to-IPv4 in parallel with IPv6-to-IPv6 communications to, from, and within a cluster | v1.19+ | Windows Server, version 2019 | See [IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack](#ipv4ipv6-dual-stack) |
| Client IP preservation | Ensures that source IP of incoming ingress traffic gets preserved. Also disables node-node forwarding. | v1.20+ | Windows Server, version 2019  | Set `service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` to "Local" and enable DSR in kube-proxy |
{{< /table >}}

##### Session affinity

Setting the maximum session sticky time for Windows services using
`service.spec.sessionAffinityConfig.clientIP.timeoutSeconds` is not supported.

#### DNS {#dns-limitations}

* ClusterFirstWithHostNet is not supported for DNS. Windows treats all names with a
  `.` as a FQDN and skips FQDN resolution
* On Linux, you have a DNS suffix list, which is used when trying to resolve PQDNs. On
  Windows, you can only have 1 DNS suffix, which is the DNS suffix associated with that
  pod's namespace (mydns.svc.cluster.local for example). Windows can resolve FQDNs
  and services or names resolvable with just that suffix. For example, a pod spawned
  in the default namespace, will have the DNS suffix **default.svc.cluster.local**.
  Inside a Windows pod, you can resolve both **kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local**
  and **kubernetes**, but not the in-betweens, like **kubernetes.default** or
  **kubernetes.default.svc**.
* On Windows, there are multiple DNS resolvers that can be used. As these come with
  slightly different behaviors, using the `Resolve-DNSName` utility for name query
  resolutions is recommended.

#### IPv6 networking

Kubernetes on Windows does not support single-stack "IPv6-only" networking. However,
dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networking for pods and nodes with single-family services
is supported.

You can enable IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking for `l2bridge` networks using the
`IPv6DualStack` [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).
See [enable IPv4/IPv6 dual stack](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack#enable-ipv4ipv6-dual-stack) for more details.

{{< note >}}
Overlay (VXLAN) networks on Windows do not support dual-stack networking.
{{< /note >}}

### Persistent storage {#compatibility-storage}

Windows has a layered filesystem driver to mount container layers and create a copy
filesystem based on NTFS. All file paths in the container are resolved only within
the context of that container.

* With Docker, volume mounts can only target a directory in the container, and not
  an individual file. This limitation does not exist with CRI-containerD runtime.
* Volume mounts cannot project files or directories back to the host filesystem.
* Read-only filesystems are not supported because write access is always required
  for the Windows registry and SAM database. However, read-only volumes are supported.
* Volume user-masks and permissions are not available. Because the SAM is not shared
  between the host & container, there's no mapping between them. All permissions are
  resolved within the context of the container.

As a result, the following storage functionality is not supported on Windows nodes:

* Volume subpath mounts: only the entire volume can be mounted in a Windows container
* Subpath volume mounting for Secrets
* Host mount projection
* Read-only root filesystem (mapped volumes still support `readOnly`)
* Block device mapping
* Memory as the storage medium (for example, `emptyDir.medium` set to `Memory`)
* File system features like uid/gid; per-user Linux filesystem permissions
* DefaultMode (due to UID/GID dependency)
* NFS based storage/volume support
* Expanding the mounted volume (resizefs)

Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="volumes" term_id="volume" >}} enable complex
applications, with data persistence and Pod volume sharing requirements, to be deployed
on Kubernetes. Management of persistent volumes associated with a specific storage
back-end or protocol includes actions such as provisioning/de-provisioning/resizing
of volumes, attaching/detaching a volume to/from a Kubernetes node and
mounting/dismounting a volume to/from individual containers in a pod that needs to
persist data.

The code implementing these volume management actions for a specific storage back-end
or protocol is shipped in the form of a Kubernetes volume
[plugin](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#types-of-volumes).
The following broad classes of Kubernetes volume plugins are supported on Windows:

##### In-tree volume plugins

Code associated with in-tree volume plugins ship as part of the core Kubernetes code
base. Deployment of in-tree volume plugins do not require installation of additional
scripts or deployment of separate containerized plugin components. These plugins can
handle provisioning/de-provisioning and resizing of volumes in the storage backend,
attaching/detaching of volumes to/from a Kubernetes node and mounting/dismounting a
volume to/from individual containers in a pod. The following in-tree plugins support
persistent storage on Windows nodes:

* [`awsElasticBlockStore`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#awselasticblockstore)
* [`azureDisk`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#azuredisk)
* [`azureFile`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#azurefile)
* [`gcePersistentDisk`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#gcepersistentdisk)
* [`vsphereVolume`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#vspherevolume)

#### FlexVolume plugins

Code associated with [FlexVolume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#flexVolume)
plugins ship as out-of-tree scripts or binaries that need to be deployed directly
on the host. FlexVolume plugins handle attaching/detaching of volumes to/from a
Kubernetes node and mounting/dismounting a volume to/from individual containers
in a pod. Provisioning/De-provisioning of persistent volumes associated
with FlexVolume plugins may be handled through an external provisioner that
is typically separate from the FlexVolume plugins. The following FlexVolume
[plugins](https://github.com/Microsoft/K8s-Storage-Plugins/tree/master/flexvolume/windows),
deployed as PowerShell scripts on the host, support Windows nodes:

* [SMB](https://github.com/microsoft/K8s-Storage-Plugins/tree/master/flexvolume/windows/plugins/microsoft.com~smb.cmd)
* [iSCSI](https://github.com/microsoft/K8s-Storage-Plugins/tree/master/flexvolume/windows/plugins/microsoft.com~iscsi.cmd)

#### CSI plugins

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.19" state="beta" >}}

Code associated with {{< glossary_tooltip text="CSI" term_id="csi" >}} plugins ship
as out-of-tree scripts and binaries that are typically distributed as container
images and deployed using standard Kubernetes constructs like DaemonSets and
StatefulSets.
CSI plugins handle a wide range of volume management actions in Kubernetes:
provisioning/de-provisioning/resizing of volumes, attaching/detaching of volumes
to/from a Kubernetes node and mounting/dismounting a volume to/from individual
containers in a pod, backup/restore of persistent data using snapshots and cloning.
CSI plugins typically consist of node plugins (that run on each node as a DaemonSet)
and controller plugins.

CSI node plugins (especially those associated with persistent volumes exposed as
either block devices or over a shared file-system) need to perform various privileged
operations like scanning of disk devices, mounting of file systems, etc. These
operations differ for each host operating system. For Linux worker nodes, containerized
CSI node plugins are typically deployed as privileged containers. For Windows worker
nodes, privileged operations for containerized CSI node plugins is supported using
[csi-proxy](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-proxy), a community-managed,
stand-alone binary that needs to be pre-installed on each Windows node.

For more details, refer to the deployment guide of the CSI plugin you wish to deploy.

### Command line options for the kubelet {#kubelet-compatibility}

The behavior of some kubelet command line options behave differently on Windows, as described below:

* The `--windows-priorityclass` lets you set the scheduling priority of the kubelet process (see [CPU resource management](#resource-management-cpu))
* The `--kubelet-reserve`, `--system-reserve` , and `--eviction-hard` flags update [NodeAllocatable](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable)
* Eviction by using `--enforce-node-allocable` is not implemented
* Eviction by using `--eviction-hard` and `--eviction-soft` are not implemented
* A kubelet running on a Windows node does not have memory
  restrictions. `--kubelet-reserve` and `--system-reserve` do not set limits on
  kubelet or processes running on the host. This means kubelet or a process on the host
  could cause memory resource starvation outside the node-allocatable and scheduler.
* The `MemoryPressure` Condition is not implemented
* The kubelet does not take OOM eviction actions

### API compatibility {#api}

There are no differences in how most of the Kubernetes APIs work for Windows. The
subtleties around what's different come down to differences in the OS and container
runtime. In certain situations, some properties on workload resources were designed
under the assumption that they would be implemented on Linux, and fail to run on Windows.

At a high level, these OS concepts are different:

* Identity - Linux uses userID (UID) and groupID (GID) which
  are represented as integer types. User and group names
  are not canonical - they are just an alias in `/etc/groups`
  or `/etc/passwd` back to UID+GID. Windows uses a larger binary
  [security identifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/security-identifiers) (SID)
  which is stored in the Windows Security Access Manager (SAM) database. This
  database is not shared between the host and containers, or between containers.
* File permissions - Windows uses an access control list based on (SIDs), whereas
  POSIX systems such as Linux use a bitmask based on object permissions and UID+GID,
  plus _optional_ access control lists.
* File paths - the convention on Windows is to use `\` instead of `/`. The Go IO
  libraries typically accept both and just make it work, but when you're setting a
  path or command line that's interpreted inside a container, `\` may be needed.
* Signals - Windows interactive apps handle termination differently, and can
  implement one or more of these:
  * A UI thread handles well-defined messages including `WM_CLOSE`.
  * Console apps handle Ctrl-C or Ctrl-break using a Control Handler.
  * Services register a Service Control Handler function that can accept
    `SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP` control codes.

Container exit codes follow the same convention where 0 is success, and nonzero is failure.
The specific error codes may differ across Windows and Linux. However, exit codes
passed from the Kubernetes components (kubelet, kube-proxy) are unchanged.

##### Field compatibility for container specifications {#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers}

The following list documents differences between how Pod container specifications
work between Windows and Linux:

* `limits.cpu` and `limits.memory` - Windows doesn't use hard limits
  for CPU allocations. Instead, a share system is used.
  The fields based on millicores are scaled into
  relative shares that are followed by the Windows scheduler
  See [`kuberuntime/helpers_windows.go`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/kubelet/kuberuntime/helpers_windows.go),
  and [Implementing resource controls for Windows containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/resource-controls)
  in Microsoft's virtualization documentation.
* Huge pages are not implemented in the Windows container
  runtime, and are not available. They require [asserting a user
  privilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Memory/large-page-support)
  that's not configurable for containers.
* `requests.cpu` and `requests.memory` - requests are subtracted
  from node available resources, so they can be used to avoid overprovisioning a
  node. However, they cannot be used to guarantee resources in an overprovisioned
  node. They should be applied to all containers as a best practice if the operator
  wants to avoid overprovisioning entirely.
* `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation` -
   not possible on Windows; none of the capabilities are hooked up
* `securityContext.capabilities` -
   POSIX capabilities are not implemented on Windows
* `securityContext.privileged` -
   Windows doesn't support privileged containers
* `securityContext.procMount` -
   Windows doesn't have a `/proc` filesystem
* `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem` -
   not possible on Windows; write access is required for registry & system
   processes to run inside the container
* `EcurityContext.runAsGroup` -
   not possible on Windows as there is no GID support
* `ecurityContext.runAsNonRoot` -
   Windows does not have a root user. The closest equivalent is `ContainerAdministrator`
   which is an identity that doesn't exist on the node.
* `securityContext.runAsUser` -
   use [`runAsUsername`](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-runasusername)
   instead
* `securityContext.seLinuxOptions` -
   not possible on Windows as SELinux is Linux-specific
* `terminationMessagePath` -
   this has some limitations in that Windows doesn't support mapping single files. The
   default value is `/dev/termination-log`, which does work because it does not
   exist on Windows by default.

##### Field compatibility for Pod specifications {#compatibility-v1-pod}

The following list documents differences between how Pod specifications work between Windows and Linux:

* `hostIPC` and `hostpid` - host namespace sharing is not possible on Windows
* `hostNetwork` - There is no Windows OS support to share the host network
* `dnsPolicy` - setting the Pod `dnsPolicy` to `ClusterFirstWithHostNet` is
   not supported on Windows because host networking is not provided. Pods always
   run with a container network.
* `podSecurityContext` (see below)
* `shareProcessNamespace` - this is a beta feature, and depends on Linux namespaces
  which are not implemented on Windows. Windows cannot share process namespaces or
  the container's root filesystem. Only the network can be shared.
* `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` - this is not fully implemented in Docker on Windows,
  see the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25982).
  The behavior today is that the ENTRYPOINT process is sent CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT,
  then Windows waits 5 seconds by default, and finally shuts down
  all processes using the normal Windows shutdown behavior. The 5
  second default is actually in the Windows registry
  [inside the container](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25982#issuecomment-426441183),
  so it can be overridden when the container is built.
* `volumeDevices` - this is a beta feature, and is not implemented on Windows.
  Windows cannot attach raw block devices to pods.
* `volumes`
  * If you define an `emptyDir` volume, you cannot set its volume source to `memory`.
* You cannot enable `mountPropagation` for volume mounts as this is not
  supported on Windows.

##### Field compatibility for Pod security context {#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers-securitycontext}

None of the Pod [`securityContext`](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#security-context) fields work on Windows.

### Node problem detector

The node problem detector (see
[Monitor Node Health](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/monitor-node-health/))
is not compatible with Windows.

### Pause container

In a Kubernetes Pod, an infrastructure or “pause” container is first created
to host the container. In Linux, the cgroups and namespaces that make up a pod
need a process to maintain their continued existence; the pause process provides
this. Containers that belong to the same pod, including infrastructure and worker
containers, share a common network endpoint (same IPv4 and / or IPv6 address, same
network port spaces). Kubernetes uses pause containers to allow for worker containers
crashing or restarting without losing any of the networking configuration.

Kubernetes maintains a multi-architecture image that includes support for Windows.
For Kubernetes v1.22 the recommended pause image is `k8s.gcr.io/pause:3.5`.
The [source code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/build/pause)
is available on GitHub.

Microsoft maintains a different multi-architecture image, with Linux and Windows
amd64 support, that you can find as `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:3.5`.
This image is built from the same source as the Kubernetes maintained image but
all of the Windows binaries are [authenticode signed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/authenticode) by Microsoft.
The Kubernetes project recommends using the Microsoft maintained image if you are
deploying to a production or production-like environment that requires signed
binaries.

### Container runtimes {#container-runtime}

You need to install a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="container runtime" term_id="container-runtime" >}}
into each node in the cluster so that Pods can run there.

The following container runtimes work with Windows:

{{% thirdparty-content %}}

#### cri-containerd

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.20" state="stable" >}}

You can use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="containerd" text="ContainerD" >}} 1.4.0+
as the container runtime for Kubernetes nodes that run Windows.

Learn how to [install ContainerD on a Windows node](/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/#install-containerd).

{{< note >}}
There is a [known limitation](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-gmsa/#gmsa-limitations)
when using GMSA with containerd to access Windows network shares, which requires a
kernel patch.
{{< /note >}}

#### Docker EE

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.14" state="stable" >}}

[Docker EE](https://docs.mirantis.com/containers/v3.0/dockeree-products/dee-intro.html)-basic 19.03+ is available as a container runtime for all Windows Server versions. This works with the legacy dockershim adapter.

See [Install Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/deploy-containers-on-server#install-docker) for more information.

## Windows OS version compatibility {#windows-os-version-support}

On Windows nodes, strict compatibility rules apply where the host OS version must
match the container base image OS version. Only Windows containers with a container
operating system of Windows Server 2019 are fully supported.

For Kubernetes v1.22, operating system compatibility for Windows nodes (and Pods)
is as follows:

Windows Server LTSC release
: Windows Server 2019

Windows Server SAC release
: Windows Server version 2004, Windows Server version 20H2

The Kubernetes [version-skew policy](/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/) also applies.

## Security for Windows nodes {#security}

On Windows, data from Secrets are written out in clear text onto the node's local
storage (as compared to using tmpfs / in-memory filesystems on Linux). As a cluster
operator, you should take both of the following additional measures:

1. Use file ACLs to secure the Secrets' file location.
1. Apply volume-level encryption using [BitLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-how-to-deploy-on-windows-server).

[RunAsUsername](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-runasusername)
can be specified for Windows Pods or containers to execute the container
processes as a node-default user. This is roughly equivalent to
[RunAsUser](/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#users-and-groups).

Linux-specific pod security context privileges such as SELinux, AppArmor, Seccomp, or capabilities (POSIX capabilities), and others are not supported.

Privileged containers are [not supported](#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers-securitycontext) on Windows.

## Getting help and troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Your main source of help for troubleshooting your Kubernetes cluster should start
with the [Troubleshooting](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/troubleshooting/)
page.

Some additional, Windows-specific troubleshooting help is included
in this section. Logs are an important element of troubleshooting
issues in Kubernetes. Make sure to include them any time you seek
troubleshooting assistance from other contributors. Follow the
instructions in the
SIG Windows [contributing guide on gathering logs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-windows/CONTRIBUTING.md#gathering-logs).

### Node-level troubleshooting {#troubleshooting-node}

1. How do I know `start.ps1` completed successfully?

   You should see kubelet, kube-proxy, and (if you chose Flannel as your networking
   solution) flanneld host-agent processes running on your node, with running logs
   being displayed in separate PowerShell windows. In addition to this, your Windows
   node should be listed as "Ready" in your Kubernetes cluster.

1. Can I configure the Kubernetes node processes to run in the background as services?

   The kubelet and kube-proxy are already configured to run as native Windows Services,
   offering resiliency by re-starting the services automatically in the event of
   failure (for example a process crash). You have two options for configuring these
   node components as services.

    1. As native Windows Services

        You can run the kubelet and kube-proxy as native Windows Services using `sc.exe`.

        ```powershell
        # Create the services for kubelet and kube-proxy in two separate commands
        sc.exe create <component_name> binPath= "<path_to_binary> --service <other_args>"

        # Please note that if the arguments contain spaces, they must be escaped.
        sc.exe create kubelet binPath= "C:\kubelet.exe --service --hostname-override 'minion' <other_args>"

        # Start the services
        Start-Service kubelet
        Start-Service kube-proxy

        # Stop the service
        Stop-Service kubelet (-Force)
        Stop-Service kube-proxy (-Force)

        # Query the service status
        Get-Service kubelet
        Get-Service kube-proxy
        ```

    1. Using `nssm.exe`

       You can also always use alternative service managers like
       [nssm.exe](https://nssm.cc/) to run these processes (flanneld,
       kubelet & kube-proxy) in the background for you. You can use this
       [sample script](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/tree/master/Kubernetes/flannel/register-svc.ps1),
       leveraging nssm.exe to register kubelet, kube-proxy, and flanneld.exe to run
       as Windows services in the background.

       ```powershell
       register-svc.ps1 -NetworkMode <Network mode> -ManagementIP <Windows Node IP> -ClusterCIDR <Cluster subnet> -KubeDnsServiceIP <Kube-dns Service IP> -LogDir <Directory to place logs>

       # NetworkMode      = The network mode l2bridge (flannel host-gw, also the default value) or overlay (flannel vxlan) chosen as a network solution
       # ManagementIP     = The IP address assigned to the Windows node. You can use ipconfig to find this
       # ClusterCIDR      = The cluster subnet range. (Default value 10.244.0.0/16)
       # KubeDnsServiceIP = The Kubernetes DNS service IP (Default value 10.96.0.10)
       # LogDir           = The directory where kubelet and kube-proxy logs are redirected into their respective output files (Default value C:\k)
       ```

       If the above referenced script is not suitable, you can manually configure
       `nssm.exe` using the following examples.

       ```powershell
       # Register flanneld.exe
       nssm install flanneld C:\flannel\flanneld.exe
       nssm set flanneld AppParameters --kubeconfig-file=c:\k\config --iface=<ManagementIP> --ip-masq=1 --kube-subnet-mgr=1
       nssm set flanneld AppEnvironmentExtra NODE_NAME=<hostname>
       nssm set flanneld AppDirectory C:\flannel
       nssm start flanneld

       # Register kubelet.exe
       # Microsoft releases the pause infrastructure container at mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:1.4.1
       nssm install kubelet C:\k\kubelet.exe
       nssm set kubelet AppParameters --hostname-override=<hostname> --v=6 --pod-infra-container-image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:1.4.1 --resolv-conf="" --allow-privileged=true --enable-debugging-handlers --cluster-dns=<DNS-service-IP> --cluster-domain=cluster.local --kubeconfig=c:\k\config --hairpin-mode=promiscuous-bridge --image-pull-progress-deadline=20m --cgroups-per-qos=false  --log-dir=<log directory> --logtostderr=false --enforce-node-allocatable="" --network-plugin=cni --cni-bin-dir=c:\k\cni --cni-conf-dir=c:\k\cni\config
       nssm set kubelet AppDirectory C:\k
       nssm start kubelet

       # Register kube-proxy.exe (l2bridge / host-gw)
       nssm install kube-proxy C:\k\kube-proxy.exe
       nssm set kube-proxy AppDirectory c:\k
       nssm set kube-proxy AppParameters --v=4 --proxy-mode=kernelspace --hostname-override=<hostname>--kubeconfig=c:\k\config --enable-dsr=false --log-dir=<log directory> --logtostderr=false
       nssm.exe set kube-proxy AppEnvironmentExtra KUBE_NETWORK=cbr0
       nssm set kube-proxy DependOnService kubelet
       nssm start kube-proxy

       # Register kube-proxy.exe (overlay / vxlan)
       nssm install kube-proxy C:\k\kube-proxy.exe
       nssm set kube-proxy AppDirectory c:\k
       nssm set kube-proxy AppParameters --v=4 --proxy-mode=kernelspace --feature-gates="WinOverlay=true" --hostname-override=<hostname> --kubeconfig=c:\k\config --network-name=vxlan0 --source-vip=<source-vip> --enable-dsr=false --log-dir=<log directory> --logtostderr=false
       nssm set kube-proxy DependOnService kubelet
       nssm start kube-proxy
       ```

       For initial troubleshooting, you can use the following flags in [nssm.exe](https://nssm.cc/) to redirect stdout and stderr to a output file:

       ```powershell
       nssm set <Service Name> AppStdout C:\k\mysvc.log
       nssm set <Service Name> AppStderr C:\k\mysvc.log
       ```

       For additional details, see [NSSM - the Non-Sucking Service Manager](https://nssm.cc/usage).

1. My Pods are stuck at "Container Creating" or restarting over and over

   Check that your pause image is compatible with your OS version. The
   [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/deploying-resources)
   assume that both the OS and the containers are version 1803. If you have a later
   version of Windows, such as an Insider build, you need to adjust the images
   accordingly. See [Pause container](#pause-container) for more details.

### Network troubleshooting {#troubleshooting-network}

1. My Windows Pods do not have network connectivity

   If you are using virtual machines, ensure that MAC spoofing is **enabled** on all
   the VM network adapter(s).

1. My Windows Pods cannot ping external resources

   Windows Pods do not have outbound rules programmed for the ICMP protocol. However,
   TCP/UDP is supported. When trying to demonstrate connectivity to resources
   outside of the cluster, substitute `ping <IP>` with corresponding
   `curl <IP>` commands.

   If you are still facing problems, most likely your network configuration in
   [cni.conf](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/blob/master/Kubernetes/flannel/l2bridge/cni/config/cni.conf)
   deserves some extra attention. You can always edit this static file. The
   configuration update will apply to any new Kubernetes resources.

   One of the Kubernetes networking requirements
   (see [Kubernetes model](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/)) is
   for cluster communication to occur without
   NAT internally. To honor this requirement, there is an
   [ExceptionList](https://github.com/Microsoft/SDN/blob/master/Kubernetes/flannel/l2bridge/cni/config/cni.conf#L20)
   for all the communication where you do not want outbound NAT to occur. However,
   this also means that you need to exclude the external IP you are trying to query
   from the `ExceptionList`. Only then will the traffic originating from your Windows
   pods be SNAT'ed correctly to receive a response from the outside world. In this
   regard, your `ExceptionList` in `cni.conf` should look as follows:

   ```conf
   "ExceptionList": [
                   "10.244.0.0/16",  # Cluster subnet
                   "10.96.0.0/12",   # Service subnet
                   "10.127.130.0/24" # Management (host) subnet
               ]
   ```

1. My Windows node cannot access `NodePort` type Services

   Local NodePort access from the node itself fails. This is a known
   limitation. NodePort access works from other nodes or external clients.

1. vNICs and HNS endpoints of containers are being deleted

   This issue can be caused when the `hostname-override` parameter is not passed to
   [kube-proxy](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/). To resolve
   it, users need to pass the hostname to kube-proxy as follows:

   ```powershell
   C:\k\kube-proxy.exe --hostname-override=$(hostname)
   ```

1. With flannel, my nodes are having issues after rejoining a cluster

   Whenever a previously deleted node is being re-joined to the cluster, flannelD
   tries to assign a new pod subnet to the node. Users should remove the old pod
   subnet configuration files in the following paths:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item C:\k\SourceVip.json
   Remove-Item C:\k\SourceVipRequest.json
   ```

1. After launching `start.ps1`, flanneld is stuck in "Waiting for the Network to be created"

   There are numerous reports of this [issue](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/issues/1066); most likely it is a timing issue for when the management IP of the flannel network is set. A workaround is to relaunch `start.ps1` or relaunch it manually as follows:

   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NODE_NAME", "<Windows_Worker_Hostname>")
   C:\flannel\flanneld.exe --kubeconfig-file=c:\k\config --iface=<Windows_Worker_Node_IP> --ip-masq=1 --kube-subnet-mgr=1
   ```

1. My Windows Pods cannot launch because of missing `/run/flannel/subnet.env`

   This indicates that Flannel didn't launch correctly. You can either try
   to restart `flanneld.exe` or you can copy the files over manually from
   `/run/flannel/subnet.env` on the Kubernetes master to `C:\run\flannel\subnet.env`
   on the Windows worker node and modify the `FLANNEL_SUBNET` row to a different
   number. For example, if node subnet 10.244.4.1/24 is desired:

   ```env
   FLANNEL_NETWORK=10.244.0.0/16
   FLANNEL_SUBNET=10.244.4.1/24
   FLANNEL_MTU=1500
   FLANNEL_IPMASQ=true
   ```

1. My Windows node cannot access my services using the service IP

   This is a known limitation of the networking stack on Windows. However, Windows Pods can access the Service IP.

1. No network adapter is found when starting the kubelet

   The Windows networking stack needs a virtual adapter for Kubernetes networking to work. If the following commands return no results (in an admin shell), virtual network creation — a necessary prerequisite for the kubelet to work — has failed:

   ```powershell
   Get-HnsNetwork | ? Name -ieq "cbr0"
   Get-NetAdapter | ? Name -Like "vEthernet (Ethernet*"
   ```

   Often it is worthwhile to modify the [InterfaceName](https://github.com/microsoft/SDN/blob/master/Kubernetes/flannel/start.ps1#L7) parameter of the start.ps1 script, in cases where the host's network adapter isn't "Ethernet". Otherwise, consult the output of the `start-kubelet.ps1` script to see if there are errors during virtual network creation.

1. DNS resolution is not properly working

   Check the DNS limitations for Windows in this [section](#dns-limitations).

1. `kubectl port-forward` fails with "unable to do port forwarding: wincat not found"

   This was implemented in Kubernetes 1.15 by including `wincat.exe` in the pause infrastructure container `mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:1.4.1`. Be sure to use a supported version of Kubernetes.
   If you would like to build your own pause infrastructure container be sure to include [wincat](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/build/pause/windows/wincat).

1. My Kubernetes installation is failing because my Windows Server node is behind a proxy

   If you are behind a proxy, the following PowerShell environment variables must be defined:

   ```PowerShell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTP_PROXY", "http://proxy.example.com:80/", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("HTTPS_PROXY", "http://proxy.example.com:443/", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
   ```
