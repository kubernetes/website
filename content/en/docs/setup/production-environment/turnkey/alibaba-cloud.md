---

## Alibaba Cloud Container Service

The [Alibaba Cloud Container Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/container-service) lets you run and manage Docker applications on a cluster of Alibaba Cloud ECS instances. It supports the popular open source container orchestrators: Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

To simplify cluster deployment and management, use [Kubernetes Support for Alibaba Cloud Container Service](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/kubernetes). You can get started quickly by following the [Kubernetes walk-through](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/86737.htm), and there are some [tutorials for Kubernetes Support on Alibaba Cloud](https://yq.aliyun.com/teams/11/type_blog-cid_200-page_1) in Chinese.

To use custom binaries or open source Kubernetes, follow the instructions below.

## Custom Deployments

The source code for [Kubernetes with Alibaba Cloud provider implementation](https://github.com/AliyunContainerService/kubernetes) is open source and available on GitHub.
