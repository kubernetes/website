## kind

[`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) lets you run Kubernetes on
your local computer. This tool requires that you have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and configured.

The kind [Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) page
shows you what you need to do to get up and running with kind.

## minikube

Like `kind`, [`minikube`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes
locally. `minikube` runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal
computer (including Windows, macOS and Linux PCs) so that you can try out
Kubernetes, or for daily development work.

You can follow the official
[Get Started!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) guide if your focus is
on getting the tool installed.
