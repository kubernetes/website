in a Kubernetes Pod.

## Define an environment variable for a container

When you create a Pod, you can set environment variables for the containers
that run in the Pod. To set environment variables, include the `env` or
`envFrom` field in the configuration file.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that runs one container. The configuration
file for the Pod defines an environment variable with name `DEMO_GREETING` and
value `"Hello from the environment"`. Here is the configuration manifest for the
Pod:

{{< codenew file="pods/inject/envars.yaml" >}}

1. Create a Pod based on that manifest:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/envars.yaml
    ```

1. List the running Pods:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -l purpose=demonstrate-envars
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    envar-demo      1/1       Running   0          9s
    ```

1. List the Pod's container environment variables:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec envar-demo -- printenv
    ```

    The output is similar to this:

    ```
    NODE_VERSION=4.4.2
    EXAMPLE_SERVICE_PORT_8080_TCP_ADDR=10.3.245.237
    HOSTNAME=envar-demo
    ...
    DEMO_GREETING=Hello from the environment
    DEMO_FAREWELL=Such a sweet sorrow
    ```

{{< note >}}
The environment variables set using the `env` or `envFrom` field
override any environment variables specified in the container image.

Environment variables may reference each other, however ordering is important.
Variables making use of others defined in the same context must come later in
the list. Similarly, avoid circular references.

## Using environment variables inside of your config

Environment variables that you define in a Pod's configuration can be used
elsewhere in the configuration, for example in commands and arguments that
you set for the Pod's containers.
In the example configuration below, the `GREETING`, `HONORIFIC`, and
`NAME` environment variables are set to `Warm greetings to`, `The Most
Honorable`, and `Kubernetes`, respectively. Those environment variables
are then used in the CLI arguments passed to the `env-print-demo`
container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: env-print-demo
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING
      value: "Warm greetings to"
    - name: HONORIFIC
      value: "The Most Honorable"
    - name: NAME
      value: "Kubernetes"
    command: ["echo"]
    args: ["$(GREETING) $(HONORIFIC) $(NAME)"]
```

Upon creation, the command `echo Warm greetings to The Most Honorable Kubernetes` is run on the container.
