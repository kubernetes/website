## Define an environment dependent variable for a container

When you create a Pod, you can set dependent environment variables for the containers that run in the Pod. To set dependent environment variables, you can use $(VAR_NAME) in the `value` of `env` in the configuration file.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that runs one container. The configuration
file for the Pod defines a dependent environment variable with common usage defined. Here is the configuration manifest for the
Pod:

{{% code_sample file="pods/inject/dependent-envars.yaml" %}}

1. Create a Pod based on that manifest:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/dependent-envars.yaml
   ```
   ```
   pod/dependent-envars-demo created
   ```

2. List the running Pods:

   ```shell
   kubectl get pods dependent-envars-demo
   ```
   ```
   NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   dependent-envars-demo     1/1       Running   0          9s
   ```

3. Check the logs for the container running in your Pod:

   ```shell
   kubectl logs pod/dependent-envars-demo
   ```
   ```

   UNCHANGED_REFERENCE=$(PROTOCOL)://172.17.0.1:80
   SERVICE_ADDRESS=https://172.17.0.1:80
   ESCAPED_REFERENCE=$(PROTOCOL)://172.17.0.1:80
   ```

As shown above, you have defined the correct dependency reference of `SERVICE_ADDRESS`, bad dependency reference of `UNCHANGED_REFERENCE` and skip dependent references of `ESCAPED_REFERENCE`.

When an environment variable is already defined when being referenced,
the reference can be correctly resolved, such as in the `SERVICE_ADDRESS` case.

Note that order matters in the `env` list. An environment variable is not considered
"defined" if it is specified further down the list. That is why `UNCHANGED_REFERENCE`
fails to resolve `$(PROTOCOL)` in the example above.

When the environment variable is undefined or only includes some variables, the undefined environment variable is treated as a normal string, such as `UNCHANGED_REFERENCE`. Note that incorrectly parsed environment variables, in general, will not block the container from starting.

The `$(VAR_NAME)` syntax can be escaped with a double `$`, ie: `$$(VAR_NAME)`.
Escaped references are never expanded, regardless of whether the referenced variable
is defined or not. This can be seen from the `ESCAPED_REFERENCE` case above.
