title: Expose Pod Information to Containers Through Files
content_type: task
weight: 40
---

<!-- overview -->

This page shows how a Pod can use a
[`downwardAPI` volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#downwardapi),
to expose information about itself to containers running in the Pod.
A `downwardAPI` volume can expose Pod fields and container fields.

In Kubernetes, there are two ways to expose Pod and container fields to a running container:

* [Environment variables](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
* Volume files, as explained in this task

Together, these two ways of exposing Pod and container fields are called the
_downward API_.

## Store Pod fields

In this part of exercise, you create a Pod that has one container, and you
project Pod-level fields into the running container as files.
Here is the manifest for the Pod:

{{< codenew file="pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml" >}}

In the manifest, you can see that the Pod has a `downwardAPI` Volume,
and the container mounts the volume at `/etc/podinfo`.

Look at the `items` array under `downwardAPI`. Each element of the array
defines a `downwardAPI` volume.
The first element specifies that the value of the Pod's
`metadata.labels` field should be stored in a file named `labels`.
The second element specifies that the value of the Pod's `annotations`
field should be stored in a file named `annotations`.

{{< note >}}
The fields in this example are Pod fields. They are not
fields of the container in the Pod.
{{< /note >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/dapi-volume.yaml
```

Verify that the container in the Pod is running:

```shell
kubectl get pods
```

View the container's logs:

```shell
kubectl logs kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example
```

The output shows the contents of the `labels` file and the `annotations` file:

```
cluster="test-cluster1"
rack="rack-22"
zone="us-est-coast"

build="two"
builder="john-doe"
```

Get a shell into the container that is running in your Pod:

```shell
kubectl exec -it kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example -- sh
```

In your shell, view the `labels` file:

```shell
/# cat /etc/podinfo/labels
```

The output shows that all of the Pod's labels have been written
to the `labels` file:

```shell
cluster="test-cluster1"
rack="rack-22"
zone="us-est-coast"
```

Similarly, view the `annotations` file:

```shell
/# cat /etc/podinfo/annotations
```

View the files in the `/etc/podinfo` directory:

```shell
/# ls -laR /etc/podinfo
```

In the output, you can see that the `labels` and `annotations` files
are in a temporary subdirectory: in this example,
`..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680`. In the `/etc/podinfo` directory, `..data` is
a symbolic link to the temporary subdirectory. Also in the `/etc/podinfo` directory,
`labels` and `annotations` are symbolic links.

```
drwxr-xr-x  ... Feb 6 21:47 ..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680
lrwxrwxrwx  ... Feb 6 21:47 ..data -> ..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680
lrwxrwxrwx  ... Feb 6 21:47 annotations -> ..data/annotations
lrwxrwxrwx  ... Feb 6 21:47 labels -> ..data/labels

/etc/..2982_06_02_21_47_53.299460680:
total 8
-rw-r--r--  ... Feb  6 21:47 annotations
-rw-r--r--  ... Feb  6 21:47 labels
```

Using symbolic links enables dynamic atomic refresh of the metadata; updates are
written to a new temporary directory, and the `..data` symlink is updated
atomically using [rename(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/rename.2.html).

{{< note >}}
A container using Downward API as a
[subPath](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath) volume mount will not
receive Downward API updates.
{{< /note >}}

Exit the shell:

```shell
/# exit
```

## Store container fields

The preceding exercise, you made Pod-level fields accessible using the
downward API.
In this next exercise, you are going to pass fields that are part of the Pod
definition, but taken from the specific
[container](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#Container)
rather than from the Pod overall. Here is a manifest for a Pod that again has
just one container:

{{< codenew file="pods/inject/dapi-volume-resources.yaml" >}}

In the manifest, you can see that the Pod has a
[`downwardAPI` volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#downwardapi),
and that the single container in that Pod mounts the volume at `/etc/podinfo`.

Look at the `items` array under `downwardAPI`. Each element of the array
defines a file in the downward API volume.

The first element specifies that in the container named `client-container`,
the value of the `limits.cpu` field in the format specified by `1m` should be
published as a file named `cpu_limit`. The `divisor` field is optional and has the
default value of `1`. A divisor of 1 means cores for `cpu` resources, or
bytes for `memory` resources.

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/inject/dapi-volume-resources.yaml
```

Get a shell into the container that is running in your Pod:

```shell
kubectl exec -it kubernetes-downwardapi-volume-example-2 -- sh
```

In your shell, view the `cpu_limit` file:

```shell
# Run this in a shell inside the container
cat /etc/podinfo/cpu_limit
```

You can use similar commands to view the `cpu_request`, `mem_limit` and
`mem_request` files.

## Project keys to specific paths and file permissions

You can project keys to specific paths and specific permissions on a per-file
basis. For more information, see
[Secrets](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

## {{% heading "whatsnext" %}}

* Read the [`spec`](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#PodSpec)
  API definition for Pod. This includes the definition of Container (part of Pod).
* Read the list of [available fields](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/downward-api/#available-fields) that you
  can expose using the downward API.

Read about volumes in the legacy API reference:
* Check the [`Volume`](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#volume-v1-core)
  API definition which defines a generic volume in a Pod for containers to access.
* Check the [`DownwardAPIVolumeSource`](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#downwardapivolumesource-v1-core)
  API definition which defines a volume that contains Downward API information.
* Check the [`DownwardAPIVolumeFile`](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#downwardapivolumefile-v1-core)
  API definition which contains references to object or resource fields for
  populating a file in the Downward API volume.
* Check the [`ResourceFieldSelector`](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#resourcefieldselector-v1-core)
  API definition which specifies the container resources and their output format.
