<!-- overview -->

This document shows you how to use the
[Pod failure policy](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job#pod-failure-policy),
in combination with the default
[Pod backoff failure policy](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job#pod-backoff-failure-policy),
to improve the control over the handling of container- or Pod-level failure
within a {{<glossary_tooltip text="Job" term_id="job">}}.

The definition of Pod failure policy may help you to:
* better utilize the computational resources by avoiding unnecessary Pod retries.
* avoid Job failures due to Pod disruptions (such {{<glossary_tooltip text="preemption" term_id="preemption" >}},
{{<glossary_tooltip text="API-initiated eviction" term_id="api-eviction" >}}
or {{<glossary_tooltip text="taint" term_id="taint" >}}-based eviction).

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

You should already be familiar with the basic use of [Job](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).

{{< include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" >}} {{< version-check >}}

Ensure that the [feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
`PodDisruptionConditions` and `JobPodFailurePolicy` are both enabled in your cluster.

## Using Pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary Pod retries

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
avoid unnecessary Pod restarts when a Pod failure indicates a non-retriable
software bug.

First, create a Job based on the config:

{{< codenew file="/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml" >}}

by running:

```sh
kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-failjob.yaml
```

After around 30s the entire Job should be terminated. Inspect the status of the Job by running:

```sh
kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-failjob -o yaml
```

In the Job status, see a job `Failed` condition with the field `reason`
equal `PodFailurePolicy`. Additionally, the `message` field contains a
more detailed information about the Job termination, such as:
`Container main for pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob-8ckj8 failed with exit code 42 matching FailJob rule at index 0`.

For comparison, if the Pod failure policy was disabled it would take 6 retries
of the Pod, taking at least 2 minutes.

### Clean up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-failjob
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

## Using Pod failure policy to ignore Pod disruptions

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
ignore Pod disruptions from incrementing the Pod retry counter towards the
`.spec.backoffLimit` limit.

{{< caution >}}
Timing is important for this example, so you may want to read the steps before
execution. In order to trigger a Pod disruption it is important to drain the
node while the Pod is running on it (within 90s since the Pod is scheduled).
{{< /caution >}}

1. Create a Job based on the config:

   {{< codenew file="/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore.yaml" >}}

   by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-ignore.yaml
   ```

2. Run this command to check the `nodeName` the Pod is scheduled to:

   ```sh
   nodeName=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-ignore -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.nodeName}')
   ```

3. Drain the node to evict the Pod before it completes (within 90s):
   
   ```sh
   kubectl drain nodes/$nodeName --ignore-daemonsets --grace-period=0
   ```

4. Inspect the `.status.failed` to check the counter for the Job is not incremented:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-ignore -o yaml
   ```

5. Uncordon the node:

   ```sh
   kubectl uncordon nodes/$nodeName
   ```

The Job resumes and succeeds.

For comparison, if the Pod failure policy was disabled the Pod disruption would
result in terminating the entire Job (as the `.spec.backoffLimit` is set to 0).

### Cleaning up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-ignore
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

## Using Pod failure policy to avoid unnecessary Pod retries based on custom Pod Conditions

With the following example, you can learn how to use Pod failure policy to
avoid unnecessary Pod restarts based on custom Pod Conditions.

{{< note >}}
The example below works since version 1.27 as it relies on transitioning of
deleted pods, in the `Pending` phase, to a terminal phase
(see: [Pod Phase](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase)).
{{< /note >}}

1. First, create a Job based on the config:

   {{< codenew file="/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml" >}}

   by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl create -f job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue.yaml
   ```

   Note that, the image is misconfigured, as it does not exist.

2. Inspect the status of the job's Pods by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml
   ```

   You will see output similar to this:
   ```yaml
   containerStatuses:
   - image: non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example
      ...
      state:
      waiting:
         message: Back-off pulling image "non-existing-repo/non-existing-image:example"
         reason: ImagePullBackOff
         ...
   phase: Pending
   ```

   Note that the pod remains in the `Pending` phase as it fails to pull the
   misconfigured image. This, in principle, could be a transient issue and the
   image could get pulled. However, in this case, the image does not exist so
   we indicate this fact by a custom condition.

3. Add the custom condition. First prepare the patch by running:

   ```sh
   cat <<EOF > patch.yaml
   status:
     conditions:
     - type: ConfigIssue
       status: "True"
       reason: "NonExistingImage"
       lastTransitionTime: "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
   EOF
   ```
   Second, select one of the pods created by the job by running:
   ```
   podName=$(kubectl get pods -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
   ```

   Then, apply the patch on one of the pods by running the following command:

   ```sh
   kubectl patch pod $podName --subresource=status --patch-file=patch.yaml
   ```

   If applied successfully, you will get a notification like this:

   ```sh
   pod/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp patched
   ```

4. Delete the pod to transition it to `Failed` phase, by running the command:

   ```sh
   kubectl delete pods/$podName
   ```

5. Inspect the status of the Job by running:

   ```sh
   kubectl get jobs -l job-name=job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue -o yaml
   ```

   In the Job status, see a job `Failed` condition with the field `reason`
   equal `PodFailurePolicy`. Additionally, the `message` field contains a
   more detailed information about the Job termination, such as:
   `Pod default/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue-k6pvp has condition ConfigIssue matching FailJob rule at index 0`.

{{< note >}}
In a production environment, the steps 3 and 4 should be automated by a
user-provided controller.

### Cleaning up

Delete the Job you created:

```sh
kubectl delete jobs/job-pod-failure-policy-config-issue
```

The cluster automatically cleans up the Pods.

## Alternatives

You could rely solely on the
[Pod backoff failure policy](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job#pod-backoff-failure-policy),
by specifying the Job's `.spec.backoffLimit` field. However, in many situations
it is problematic to find a balance between setting a low value for `.spec.backoffLimit`
 to avoid unnecessary Pod retries, yet high enough to make sure the Job would
not be terminated by Pod disruptions.
