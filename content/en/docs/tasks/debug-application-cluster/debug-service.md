title: Debug Services

<!-- overview -->
An issue that comes up rather frequently for new installations of Kubernetes is
that a Service is not working properly.  You've run your Pods through a
Deployment (or other workload controller) and created a Service, but you
get no response when you try to access it.  This document will hopefully help
you to figure out what's going wrong.

<!-- body -->

## Running commands in a Pod

For many steps here you will want to see what a Pod running in the cluster
sees.  The simplest way to do this is to run an interactive busybox Pod:

```none
kubectl run -it --rm --restart=Never busybox --image=gcr.io/google-containers/busybox sh
```

{{< note >}}
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
{{< /note >}}

If you already have a running Pod that you prefer to use, you can run a
command in it using:

```shell
kubectl exec <POD-NAME> -c <CONTAINER-NAME> -- <COMMAND>
```

## Setup

For the purposes of this walk-through, let's run some Pods.  Since you're
probably debugging your own Service you can substitute your own details, or you
can follow along and get a second data point.

```shell
kubectl create deployment hostnames --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
```
```none
deployment.apps/hostnames created
```

`kubectl` commands will print the type and name of the resource created or mutated, which can then be used in subsequent commands.

Let's scale the deployment to 3 replicas.
```shell
kubectl scale deployment hostnames --replicas=3
```
```none
deployment.apps/hostnames scaled
```

Note that this is the same as if you had started the Deployment with the following
YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hostnames
  name: hostnames
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hostnames
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hostnames
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hostnames
        image: k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
```

The label "app" is automatically set by `kubectl create deployment` to the name of the
Deployment.

You can confirm your Pods are running:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames
```
```none
NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw   1/1       Running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-ly40y   1/1       Running   0          2m
hostnames-632524106-tlaok   1/1       Running   0          2m
```

You can also confirm that your Pods are serving.  You can get the list of
Pod IP addresses and test them directly.

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames \
    -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{.status.podIP}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```
```none
10.244.0.5
10.244.0.6
10.244.0.7
```

The example container used for this walk-through simply serves its own hostname
via HTTP on port 9376, but if you are debugging your own app, you'll want to
use whatever port number your Pods are listening on.

From within a pod:

```shell
for ep in 10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376; do
    wget -qO- $ep
done
```

This should produce something like:

```
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y
hostnames-632524106-tlaok
```

If you are not getting the responses you expect at this point, your Pods
might not be healthy or might not be listening on the port you think they are.
You might find `kubectl logs` to be useful for seeing what is happening, or
perhaps you need to `kubectl exec` directly into your Pods and debug from
there.

Assuming everything has gone to plan so far, you can start to investigate why
your Service doesn't work.

## Does the Service exist?

The astute reader will have noticed that you did not actually create a Service
yet - that is intentional.  This is a step that sometimes gets forgotten, and
is the first thing to check.

What would happen if you tried to access a non-existent Service?  If
you have another Pod that consumes this Service by name you would get
something like:

```shell
wget -O- hostnames
```
```none
Resolving hostnames (hostnames)... failed: Name or service not known.
wget: unable to resolve host address 'hostnames'
```

The first thing to check is whether that Service actually exists:

```shell
kubectl get svc hostnames
```
```none
No resources found.
Error from server (NotFound): services "hostnames" not found
```

Let's create the Service.  As before, this is for the walk-through - you can
use your own Service's details here.

```shell
kubectl expose deployment hostnames --port=80 --target-port=9376
```
```none
service/hostnames exposed
```

And read it back, just to be sure:

```shell
kubectl get svc hostnames
```
```none
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
hostnames   ClusterIP   10.0.1.175   <none>        80/TCP    5s
```

Now you know that the Service exists.

As before, this is the same as if you had started the Service with YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hostnames
  name: hostnames
spec:
  selector:
    app: hostnames
  ports:
  - name: default
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
```

In order to highlight the full range of configuration, the Service you created
here uses a different port number than the Pods.  For many real-world
Services, these values might be the same.

## Does the Service work by DNS name?

One of the most common ways that clients consume a Service is through a DNS
name.

From a Pod in the same Namespace:

```shell
nslookup hostnames
```
```none
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      hostnames
Address 1: 10.0.1.175 hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
```

If this fails, perhaps your Pod and Service are in different
Namespaces, try a namespace-qualified name (again, from within a Pod):

```shell
nslookup hostnames.default
```
```none
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      hostnames.default
Address 1: 10.0.1.175 hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
```

If this works, you'll need to adjust your app to use a cross-namespace name, or
run your app and Service in the same Namespace.  If this still fails, try a
fully-qualified name:

```shell
nslookup hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
```
```none
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
Address 1: 10.0.1.175 hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
```

Note the suffix here: "default.svc.cluster.local".  The "default" is the
Namespace you're operating in.  The "svc" denotes that this is a Service.
The "cluster.local" is your cluster domain, which COULD be different in your
own cluster.

You can also try this from a Node in the cluster:

{{< note >}}
10.0.0.10 is the cluster's DNS Service IP, yours might be different.
{{< /note >}}

```shell
nslookup hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local 10.0.0.10
```
```none
Server:         10.0.0.10
Address:        10.0.0.10#53

Name:   hostnames.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.0.1.175
```

If you are able to do a fully-qualified name lookup but not a relative one, you
need to check that your `/etc/resolv.conf` file in your Pod is correct.  From
within a Pod:

```shell
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

You should see something like:

```
nameserver 10.0.0.10
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local example.com
options ndots:5
```

The `nameserver` line must indicate your cluster's DNS Service.  This is
passed into `kubelet` with the `--cluster-dns` flag.

The `search` line must include an appropriate suffix for you to find the
Service name.  In this case it is looking for Services in the local
Namespace ("default.svc.cluster.local"), Services in all Namespaces
("svc.cluster.local"), and lastly for names in the cluster ("cluster.local").
Depending on your own install you might have additional records after that (up
to 6 total).  The cluster suffix is passed into `kubelet` with the
`--cluster-domain` flag.  Throughout this document, the cluster suffix is
assumed to be "cluster.local".  Your own clusters might be configured
differently, in which case you should change that in all of the previous
commands.

The `options` line must set `ndots` high enough that your DNS client library
considers search paths at all.  Kubernetes sets this to 5 by default, which is
high enough to cover all of the DNS names it generates.

### Does any Service work by DNS name? {#does-any-service-exist-in-dns}

If the above still fails, DNS lookups are not working for your Service.  You
can take a step back and see what else is not working.  The Kubernetes master
Service should always work.  From within a Pod:

```shell
nslookup kubernetes.default
```
```none
Server:    10.0.0.10
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:      kubernetes.default
Address 1: 10.0.0.1 kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local
```

If this fails, please see the [kube-proxy](#is-the-kube-proxy-working) section
of this document, or even go back to the top of this document and start over,
but instead of debugging your own Service, debug the DNS Service.

## Does the Service work by IP?

Assuming you have confirmed that DNS works, the next thing to test is whether your
Service works by its IP address.  From a Pod in your cluster, access the
Service's IP (from `kubectl get` above).

```shell
for i in $(seq 1 3); do 
    wget -qO- 10.0.1.175:80
done
```

This should produce something like:

```
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y
hostnames-632524106-tlaok
```

If your Service is working, you should get correct responses.  If not, there
are a number of things that could be going wrong.  Read on.

## Is the Service defined correctly?

It might sound silly, but you should really double and triple check that your
Service is correct and matches your Pod's port.  Read back your Service
and verify it:

```shell
kubectl get service hostnames -o json
```
```json
{
    "kind": "Service",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "hostnames",
        "namespace": "default",
        "uid": "428c8b6c-24bc-11e5-936d-42010af0a9bc",
        "resourceVersion": "347189",
        "creationTimestamp": "2015-07-07T15:24:29Z",
        "labels": {
            "app": "hostnames"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "ports": [
            {
                "name": "default",
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "port": 80,
                "targetPort": 9376,
                "nodePort": 0
            }
        ],
        "selector": {
            "app": "hostnames"
        },
        "clusterIP": "10.0.1.175",
        "type": "ClusterIP",
        "sessionAffinity": "None"
    },
    "status": {
        "loadBalancer": {}
    }
}
```

* Is the Service port you are trying to access listed in `spec.ports[]`?
* Is the `targetPort` correct for your Pods (some Pods use a different port than the Service)?
* If you meant to use a numeric port, is it a number (9376) or a string "9376"?
* If you meant to use a named port, do your Pods expose a port with the same name?
* Is the port's `protocol` correct for your Pods?

## Does the Service have any Endpoints?

If you got this far, you have confirmed that your Service is correctly
defined and is resolved by DNS.  Now let's check that the Pods you ran are
actually being selected by the Service.

Earlier you saw that the Pods were running.  You can re-check that:

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=hostnames
```
```none
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw   1/1       Running   0          1h
hostnames-632524106-ly40y   1/1       Running   0          1h
hostnames-632524106-tlaok   1/1       Running   0          1h
```

The `-l app=hostnames` argument is a label selector - just like our Service
has.

The "AGE" column says that these Pods are about an hour old, which implies that
they are running fine and not crashing.

The "RESTARTS" column says that these pods are not crashing frequently or being
restarted.  Frequent restarts could lead to intermittent connectivity issues.
If the restart count is high, read more about how to [debug pods](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/#debugging-pods).

Inside the Kubernetes system is a control loop which evaluates the selector of
every Service and saves the results into a corresponding Endpoints object.

```shell
kubectl get endpoints hostnames

NAME        ENDPOINTS
hostnames   10.244.0.5:9376,10.244.0.6:9376,10.244.0.7:9376
```

This confirms that the endpoints controller has found the correct Pods for
your Service.  If the `ENDPOINTS` column is `<none>`, you should check that
the `spec.selector` field of your Service actually selects for
`metadata.labels` values on your Pods.  A common mistake is to have a typo or
other error, such as the Service selecting for `app=hostnames`, but the
Deployment specifying `run=hostnames`, as in versions previous to 1.18, where
the `kubectl run` command could have been also used to create a Deployment.

## Are the Pods working?

At this point, you know that your Service exists and has selected your Pods.
At the beginning of this walk-through, you verified the Pods themselves.
Let's check again that the Pods are actually working - you can bypass the
Service mechanism and go straight to the Pods, as listed by the Endpoints
above.

{{< note >}}
These commands use the Pod port (9376), rather than the Service port (80).
{{< /note >}}

From within a Pod:

```shell
for ep in 10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376; do
    wget -qO- $ep
done
```

This should produce something like:

```
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
hostnames-632524106-ly40y
hostnames-632524106-tlaok
```

You expect each Pod in the Endpoints list to return its own hostname.  If
this is not what happens (or whatever the correct behavior is for your own
Pods), you should investigate what's happening there.

## Is the kube-proxy working?

If you get here, your Service is running, has Endpoints, and your Pods
are actually serving.  At this point, the whole Service proxy mechanism is
suspect.  Let's confirm it, piece by piece.

The default implementation of Services, and the one used on most clusters, is
kube-proxy.  This is a program that runs on every node and configures one of a
small set of mechanisms for providing the Service abstraction.  If your
cluster does not use kube-proxy, the following sections will not apply, and you
will have to investigate whatever implementation of Services you are using.

### Is kube-proxy running?

Confirm that `kube-proxy` is running on your Nodes.  Running directly on a
Node, you should get something like the below:

```shell
ps auxw | grep kube-proxy
```
```none
root  4194  0.4  0.1 101864 17696 ?    Sl Jul04  25:43 /usr/local/bin/kube-proxy --master=https://kubernetes-master --kubeconfig=/var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig --v=2
```

Next, confirm that it is not failing something obvious, like contacting the
master.  To do this, you'll have to look at the logs.  Accessing the logs
depends on your Node OS.  On some OSes it is a file, such as
/var/log/kube-proxy.log, while other OSes use `journalctl` to access logs.  You
should see something like:

```none
I1027 22:14:53.995134    5063 server.go:200] Running in resource-only container "/kube-proxy"
I1027 22:14:53.998163    5063 server.go:247] Using iptables Proxier.

I1027 22:14:54.040154    5063 proxier.go:294] Adding new service "kube-system/kube-dns:dns" at 10.0.0.10:53/UDP

```

If you see error messages about not being able to contact the master, you
should double-check your Node configuration and installation steps.

One of the possible reasons that `kube-proxy` cannot run correctly is that the
required `conntrack` binary cannot be found. This may happen on some Linux
systems, depending on how you are installing the cluster, for example, you are
installing Kubernetes from scratch. If this is the case, you need to manually
install the `conntrack` package (e.g. `sudo apt install conntrack` on Ubuntu)
and then retry.

Kube-proxy can run in one of a few modes.  In the log listed above, the
line `Using iptables Proxier` indicates that kube-proxy is running in
"iptables" mode.  The most common other mode is "ipvs".  The older "userspace"
mode has largely been replaced by these.

#### Iptables mode

In "iptables" mode, you should see something like the following on a Node:

```shell
iptables-save | grep hostnames
```
```none
-A KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR -s 10.244.3.6/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.3.6:9376
-A KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ -s 10.244.1.7/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.1.7:9376
-A KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3 -s 10.244.2.3/32 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j MARK --set-xmark 0x00004000/0x00004000
-A KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 10.244.2.3:9376
-A KUBE-SERVICES -d 10.0.1.175/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames: cluster IP" -m tcp --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.33332999982 -j KUBE-SEP-WNBA2IHDGP2BOBGZ
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.50000000000 -j KUBE-SEP-X3P2623AGDH6CDF3
-A KUBE-SVC-NWV5X2332I4OT4T3 -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:" -j KUBE-SEP-57KPRZ3JQVENLNBR
```

For each port of each Service, there should be 1 rule in `KUBE-SERVICES` and
one `KUBE-SVC-<hash>` chain.  For each Pod endpoint, there should be a small
number of rules in that `KUBE-SVC-<hash>` and one `KUBE-SEP-<hash>` chain with
a small number of rules in it.  The exact rules will vary based on your exact
config (including node-ports and load-balancers).

#### IPVS mode

In "ipvs" mode, you should see something like the following on a Node:

```shell
ipvsadm -ln
```
```none
Prot LocalAddress:Port Scheduler Flags
  -> RemoteAddress:Port           Forward Weight ActiveConn InActConn
...
TCP  10.0.1.175:80 rr
  -> 10.244.0.5:9376               Masq    1      0          0
  -> 10.244.0.6:9376               Masq    1      0          0
  -> 10.244.0.7:9376               Masq    1      0          0
...
```

For each port of each Service, plus any NodePorts, external IPs, and
load-balancer IPs, kube-proxy will create a virtual server.  For each Pod
endpoint, it will create corresponding real servers. In this example, service
hostnames(`10.0.1.175:80`) has 3 endpoints(`10.244.0.5:9376`,
`10.244.0.6:9376`, `10.244.0.7:9376`).

#### Userspace mode

In rare cases, you may be using "userspace" mode.  From your Node:

```shell
iptables-save | grep hostnames
```
```none
-A KUBE-PORTALS-CONTAINER -d 10.0.1.175/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:default" -m tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 48577
-A KUBE-PORTALS-HOST -d 10.0.1.175/32 -p tcp -m comment --comment "default/hostnames:default" -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.240.115.247:48577
```

There should be 2 rules for each port of your Service (just one in this
example) - a "KUBE-PORTALS-CONTAINER" and a "KUBE-PORTALS-HOST".

Almost nobody should be using the "userspace" mode any more, so you won't spend
more time on it here.

### Is kube-proxy proxying?

Assuming you do see one the above cases, try again to access your Service by
IP from one of your Nodes:

```shell
curl 10.0.1.175:80
```
```none
hostnames-632524106-bbpiw
```

If this fails and you are using the userspace proxy, you can try accessing the
proxy directly.  If you are using the iptables proxy, skip this section.

Look back at the `iptables-save` output above, and extract the
port number that `kube-proxy` is using for your Service.  In the above
examples it is "48577".  Now connect to that:

```shell
curl localhost:48577
```
```none
hostnames-632524106-tlaok
```

If this still fails, look at the `kube-proxy` logs for specific lines like:

```none
Setting endpoints for default/hostnames:default to [10.244.0.5:9376 10.244.0.6:9376 10.244.0.7:9376]
```

If you don't see those, try restarting `kube-proxy` with the `-v` flag set to 4, and
then look at the logs again.

### Edge case: A Pod fails to reach itself via the Service IP {#a-pod-fails-to-reach-itself-via-the-service-ip}

This might sound unlikely, but it does happen and it is supposed to work.

This can happen when the network is not properly configured for "hairpin"
traffic, usually when `kube-proxy` is running in `iptables` mode and Pods
are connected with bridge network. The `Kubelet` exposes a `hairpin-mode`
[flag](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) that allows endpoints of a Service to loadbalance
back to themselves if they try to access their own Service VIP. The
`hairpin-mode` flag must either be set to `hairpin-veth` or
`promiscuous-bridge`.

The common steps to trouble shoot this are as follows:

* Confirm `hairpin-mode` is set to `hairpin-veth` or `promiscuous-bridge`.
You should see something like the below. `hairpin-mode` is set to
`promiscuous-bridge` in the following example.

```shell
ps auxw | grep kubelet
```
```none
root      3392  1.1  0.8 186804 65208 ?        Sl   00:51  11:11 /usr/local/bin/kubelet --enable-debugging-handlers=true --config=/etc/kubernetes/manifests --allow-privileged=True --v=4 --cluster-dns=10.0.0.10 --cluster-domain=cluster.local --configure-cbr0=true --cgroup-root=/ --system-cgroups=/system --hairpin-mode=promiscuous-bridge --runtime-cgroups=/docker-daemon --kubelet-cgroups=/kubelet --babysit-daemons=true --max-pods=110 --serialize-image-pulls=false --outofdisk-transition-frequency=0
```

* Confirm the effective `hairpin-mode`. To do this, you'll have to look at
kubelet log. Accessing the logs depends on your Node OS. On some OSes it
is a file, such as /var/log/kubelet.log, while other OSes use `journalctl`
to access logs. Please be noted that the effective hairpin mode may not
match `--hairpin-mode` flag due to compatibility. Check if there is any log
lines with key word `hairpin` in kubelet.log. There should be log lines
indicating the effective hairpin mode, like something below.

```none
I0629 00:51:43.648698    3252 kubelet.go:380] Hairpin mode set to "promiscuous-bridge"
```

* If the effective hairpin mode is `hairpin-veth`, ensure the `Kubelet` has
the permission to operate in `/sys` on node. If everything works properly,
you should see something like:

```shell
for intf in /sys/devices/virtual/net/cbr0/brif/*; do cat $intf/hairpin_mode; done
```
```none
1
1
1
1
```

* If the effective hairpin mode is `promiscuous-bridge`, ensure `Kubelet`
has the permission to manipulate linux bridge on node. If `cbr0` bridge is
used and configured properly, you should see:

```shell
ifconfig cbr0 |grep PROMISC
```
```none
UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1460  Metric:1
```

* Seek help if none of above works out.

## Seek help

If you get this far, something very strange is happening.  Your Service is
running, has Endpoints, and your Pods are actually serving.  You have DNS
working, and `kube-proxy` does not seem to be misbehaving.  And yet your
Service is not working.  Please let us know what is going on, so we can help
investigate!
