title: Auditing
---

<!-- overview -->

Kubernetes _auditing_ provides a security-relevant, chronological set of records documenting
the sequence of actions in a cluster. The cluster audits the activities generated by users,
by applications that use the Kubernetes API, and by the control plane itself.

Auditing allows cluster administrators to answer the following questions:

 - what happened?
 - when did it happen?
 - who initiated it?
 - on what did it happen?
 - where was it observed?
 - from where was it initiated?
 - to where was it going?

<!-- body -->

Audit records begin their lifecycle inside the
[kube-apiserver](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)
component. Each request on each stage
of its execution generates an audit event, which is then pre-processed according to
a certain policy and written to a backend. The policy determines what's recorded
and the backends persist the records. The current backend implementations
include logs files and webhooks.

Each request can be recorded with an associated _stage_. The defined stages are:

- `RequestReceived` - The stage for events generated as soon as the audit
  handler receives the request, and before it is delegated down the handler
  chain.
- `ResponseStarted` - Once the response headers are sent, but before the
  response body is sent. This stage is only generated for long-running requests
  (e.g. watch).
- `ResponseComplete` - The response body has been completed and no more bytes
  will be sent.
- `Panic` - Events generated when a panic occurred.

{{< note >}}
Audit events are different from the
[Event](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#event-v1-core)
API object.
{{< /note >}}

The audit logging feature increases the memory consumption of the API server
because some context required for auditing is stored for each request.
Memory consumption depends on the audit logging configuration.

## Audit policy

Audit policy defines rules about what events should be recorded and what data
they should include. The audit policy object structure is defined in the
[`audit.k8s.io` API group](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/apis/audit/v1/types.go).
When an event is processed, it's
compared against the list of rules in order. The first matching rule sets the
_audit level_ of the event. The defined audit levels are:

- `None` - don't log events that match this rule.
- `Metadata` - log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource,
  verb, etc.) but not request or response body.
- `Request` - log event metadata and request body but not response body.
  This does not apply for non-resource requests.
- `RequestResponse` - log event metadata, request and response bodies.
  This does not apply for non-resource requests.

You can pass a file with the policy to `kube-apiserver`
using the `--audit-policy-file` flag. If the flag is omitted, no events are logged.
Note that the `rules` field __must__ be provided in the audit policy file.
A policy with no (0) rules is treated as illegal.

Below is an example audit policy file:

{{< codenew file="audit/audit-policy.yaml" >}}

You can use a minimal audit policy file to log all requests at the `Metadata` level:

```yaml
# Log all requests at the Metadata level.
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: Metadata
```

If you're crafting your own audit profile, you can use the audit profile for Google Container-Optimized OS as a starting point. You can check the
[configure-helper.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/cluster/gce/gci/configure-helper.sh)
script, which generates an audit policy file. You can see most of the audit policy file by looking directly at the script.

## Audit backends

Audit backends persist audit events to an external storage.
Out of the box, the kube-apiserver provides two backends:

- Log backend, which writes events into the filesystem
- Webhook backend, which sends events to an external HTTP API

In all cases, audit events follow a structure defined by the Kubernetes API in the
`audit.k8s.io` API group. For Kubernetes {{< param "fullversion" >}}, that
API is at version
[`v1`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/apis/audit/v1/types.go).

{{< note >}}
In case of patches, request body is a JSON array with patch operations, not a JSON object
with an appropriate Kubernetes API object. For example, the following request body is a valid patch
request to `/apis/batch/v1/namespaces/some-namespace/jobs/some-job-name`:

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/parallelism",
    "value": 0
  },
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/terminationMessagePolicy"
  }
]
```

### Log backend

The log backend writes audit events to a file in [JSONlines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.
You can configure the log audit backend using the following `kube-apiserver` flags:

- `--audit-log-path` specifies the log file path that log backend uses to write
  audit events. Not specifying this flag disables log backend. `-` means standard out
- `--audit-log-maxage` defined the maximum number of days to retain old audit log files
- `--audit-log-maxbackup` defines the maximum number of audit log files to retain
- `--audit-log-maxsize` defines the maximum size in megabytes of the audit log file before it gets rotated

If your cluster's control plane runs the kube-apiserver as a Pod, remember to mount the `hostPath`
to the location of the policy file and log file, so that audit records are persisted. For example:
```shell
    --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml \
    --audit-log-path=/var/log/audit.log
```
then mount the volumes:

```yaml
...
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
    name: audit
    readOnly: true
  - mountPath: /var/log/audit.log
    name: audit-log
```
and finally configure the `hostPath`:

```yaml
...
- name: audit
  hostPath:
    path: /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
    type: File

- name: audit-log
  hostPath:
    path: /var/log/audit.log
    type: FileOrCreate

```



### Webhook backend

The webhook audit backend sends audit events to a remote web API, which is assumed to
be a form of the Kubernetes API, including means of authentication. You can configure
a webhook audit backend using the following kube-apiserver flags:

- `--audit-webhook-config-file` specifies the path to a file with a webhook
  configuration. The webhook configuration is effectively a specialized
  [kubeconfig](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters).
- `--audit-webhook-initial-backoff` specifies the amount of time to wait after the first failed
  request before retrying. Subsequent requests are retried with exponential backoff.

The webhook config file uses the kubeconfig format to specify the remote address of
the service and credentials used to connect to it.

## Event batching {#batching}

Both log and webhook backends support batching. Using webhook as an example, here's the list of
available flags. To get the same flag for log backend, replace `webhook` with `log` in the flag
name. By default, batching is enabled in `webhook` and disabled in `log`. Similarly, by default
throttling is enabled in `webhook` and disabled in `log`.

- `--audit-webhook-mode` defines the buffering strategy. One of the following:
  - `batch` - buffer events and asynchronously process them in batches. This is the default.
  - `blocking` - block API server responses on processing each individual event.
  - `blocking-strict` - Same as blocking, but when there is a failure during audit logging at the
     RequestReceived stage, the whole request to the kube-apiserver fails.

The following flags are used only in the `batch` mode:

- `--audit-webhook-batch-buffer-size` defines the number of events to buffer before batching.
  If the rate of incoming events overflows the buffer, events are dropped.
- `--audit-webhook-batch-max-size` defines the maximum number of events in one batch.
- `--audit-webhook-batch-max-wait` defines the maximum amount of time to wait before unconditionally
  batching events in the queue.
- `--audit-webhook-batch-throttle-qps` defines the maximum average number of batches generated
  per second.
- `--audit-webhook-batch-throttle-burst` defines the maximum number of batches generated at the same
  moment if the allowed QPS was underutilized previously.

## Parameter tuning

Parameters should be set to accommodate the load on the API server.

For example, if kube-apiserver receives 100 requests each second, and each request is audited only
on `ResponseStarted` and `ResponseComplete` stages, you should account for ≅200 audit
events being generated each second. Assuming that there are up to 100 events in a batch,
you should set throttling level at least 2 queries per second. Assuming that the backend can take up to
5 seconds to write events, you should set the buffer size to hold up to 5 seconds of events;
that is: 10 batches, or 1000 events.

In most cases however, the default parameters should be sufficient and you don't have to worry about
setting them manually. You can look at the following Prometheus metrics exposed by kube-apiserver
and in the logs to monitor the state of the auditing subsystem.

- `apiserver_audit_event_total` metric contains the total number of audit events exported.
- `apiserver_audit_error_total` metric contains the total number of events dropped due to an error
  during exporting.

### Log entry truncation {#truncate}

Both log and webhook backends support limiting the size of events that are logged.
As an example, the following is the list of flags available for the log backend:

- `audit-log-truncate-enabled` whether event and batch truncating is enabled.
- `audit-log-truncate-max-batch-size` maximum size in bytes of the batch sent to the underlying backend.
- `audit-log-truncate-max-event-size` maximum size in bytes of the audit event sent to the underlying backend.

By default truncate is disabled in both `webhook` and `log`, a cluster administrator should set
`audit-log-truncate-enabled` or `audit-webhook-truncate-enabled` to enable the feature.
