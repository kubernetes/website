<!-- overview -->

This doc is about cluster troubleshooting; we assume you have already ruled out your application as the root cause of the
problem you are experiencing. See
the [application troubleshooting guide](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/) for tips on application debugging.
You may also visit the [troubleshooting overview document](/docs/tasks/debug/) for more information.

## Listing your cluster

The first thing to debug in your cluster is if your nodes are all registered correctly.

Run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

And verify that all of the nodes you expect to see are present and that they are all in the `Ready` state.

To get detailed information about the overall health of your cluster, you can run:

```shell
kubectl cluster-info dump
```

### Example: debugging a down/unreachable node

Sometimes when debugging it can be useful to look at the status of a node -- for example, because
you've noticed strange behavior of a Pod that's running on the node, or to find out why a Pod
won't schedule onto the node. As with Pods, you can use `kubectl describe node` and `kubectl get
node -o yaml` to retrieve detailed information about nodes. For example, here's what you'll see if
a node is down (disconnected from the network, or kubelet dies and won't restart, etc.). Notice
the events that show the node is NotReady, and also notice that the pods are no longer running
(they are evicted after five minutes of NotReady status).

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

```none

## Looking at logs

For now, digging deeper into the cluster requires logging into the relevant machines.  Here are the locations
of the relevant log files.  On systemd-based systems, you may need to use `journalctl` instead of examining log files.

### Control Plane nodes

* `/var/log/kube-apiserver.log` - API Server, responsible for serving the API
* `/var/log/kube-scheduler.log` - Scheduler, responsible for making scheduling decisions
* `/var/log/kube-controller-manager.log` - a component that runs most Kubernetes built-in
  {{<glossary_tooltip text="controllers" term_id="controller">}}, with the notable exception of scheduling
  (the kube-scheduler handles scheduling).

### Worker Nodes

* `/var/log/kubelet.log` - logs from the kubelet, responsible for running containers on the node
* `/var/log/kube-proxy.log` - logs from `kube-proxy`, which is responsible for directing traffic to Service endpoints

## Cluster failure modes

This is an incomplete list of things that could go wrong, and how to adjust your cluster setup to mitigate the problems.

### Contributing causes

- VM(s) shutdown
- Network partition within cluster, or between cluster and users
- Crashes in Kubernetes software
- Data loss or unavailability of persistent storage (e.g. GCE PD or AWS EBS volume)
- Operator error, for example misconfigured Kubernetes software or application software

### Specific scenarios

- API server VM shutdown or apiserver crashing
  - Results
    - unable to stop, update, or start new pods, services, replication controller
    - existing pods and services should continue to work normally, unless they depend on the Kubernetes API
- API server backing storage lost
  - Results
    - the kube-apiserver component fails to start successfully and become healthy
    - kubelets will not be able to reach it but will continue to run the same pods and provide the same service proxying
    - manual recovery or recreation of apiserver state necessary before apiserver is restarted
- Supporting services (node controller, replication controller manager, scheduler, etc) VM shutdown or crashes
  - currently those are colocated with the apiserver, and their unavailability has similar consequences as apiserver
  - in future, these will be replicated as well and may not be co-located
  - they do not have their own persistent state
- Individual node (VM or physical machine) shuts down
  - Results
    - pods on that Node stop running
- Network partition
  - Results
    - partition A thinks the nodes in partition B are down; partition B thinks the apiserver is down.
      (Assuming the master VM ends up in partition A.)
- Kubelet software fault
  - Results
    - crashing kubelet cannot start new pods on the node
    - kubelet might delete the pods or not
    - node marked unhealthy
    - replication controllers start new pods elsewhere
- Cluster operator error
  - Results
    - loss of pods, services, etc
    - lost of apiserver backing store
    - users unable to read API
    - etc.

### Mitigations

- Action: Use IaaS provider's automatic VM restarting feature for IaaS VMs
  - Mitigates: Apiserver VM shutdown or apiserver crashing
  - Mitigates: Supporting services VM shutdown or crashes

- Action: Use IaaS providers reliable storage (e.g. GCE PD or AWS EBS volume) for VMs with apiserver+etcd
  - Mitigates: Apiserver backing storage lost

- Action: Use [high-availability](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/) configuration
  - Mitigates: Control plane node shutdown or control plane components (scheduler, API server, controller-manager) crashing
    - Will tolerate one or more simultaneous node or component failures
  - Mitigates: API server backing storage (i.e., etcd's data directory) lost
    - Assumes HA (highly-available) etcd configuration

- Action: Snapshot apiserver PDs/EBS-volumes periodically
  - Mitigates: Apiserver backing storage lost
  - Mitigates: Some cases of operator error
  - Mitigates: Some cases of Kubernetes software fault

- Action: use replication controller and services in front of pods
  - Mitigates: Node shutdown
  - Mitigates: Kubelet software fault

- Action: applications (containers) designed to tolerate unexpected restarts
  - Mitigates: Node shutdown
  - Mitigates: Kubelet software fault
