description: >-
  Define a range of valid CPU resource limits for a namespace, so that every new Pod
  in that namespace falls within the range you configure.

<!-- overview -->

This page shows how to set minimum and maximum values for the CPU resources used by containers
and Pods in a {{< glossary_tooltip text="namespace" term_id="namespace" >}}. You specify minimum
and maximum CPU values in a
[LimitRange](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/policy-resources/limit-range-v1/)
object. If a Pod does not meet the constraints imposed by the LimitRange, it cannot be created
in the namespace.




## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}


{{< include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" >}}

You must have access to create namespaces in your cluster.

Each node in your cluster must have at least 1.0 CPU available for Pods.
See [meaning of CPU](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu)
to learn what Kubernetes means by “1 CPU”.


<!-- steps -->

## Create a namespace

Create a namespace so that the resources you create in this exercise are
isolated from the rest of your cluster.

```shell
kubectl create namespace constraints-cpu-example
```

## Create a LimitRange and a Pod

Here's a manifest for an example {{< glossary_tooltip text="LimitRange" term_id="limitrange" >}}:

{{< codenew file="admin/resource/cpu-constraints.yaml" >}}

Create the LimitRange:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints.yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

View detailed information about the LimitRange:

```shell
kubectl get limitrange cpu-min-max-demo-lr --output=yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

The output shows the minimum and maximum CPU constraints as expected. But
notice that even though you didn't specify default values in the configuration
file for the LimitRange, they were created automatically.

```yaml
limits:
- default:
    cpu: 800m
  defaultRequest:
    cpu: 800m
  max:
    cpu: 800m
  min:
    cpu: 200m
  type: Container
```

Now whenever you create a Pod in the constraints-cpu-example namespace (or some other client
of the Kubernetes API creates an equivalent Pod), Kubernetes performs these steps:

* If any container in that Pod does not specify its own CPU request and limit, the control plane
  assigns the default CPU request and limit to that container.

* Verify that every container in that Pod specifies a CPU request that is greater than or equal to 200 millicpu.

* Verify that every container in that Pod specifies a CPU limit that is less than or equal to 800 millicpu.

{{< note >}}
When creating a `LimitRange` object, you can specify limits on huge-pages
or GPUs as well. However, when both `default` and `defaultRequest` are specified
on these resources, the two values must be the same.
{{< /note >}}

Here's a manifest for a Pod that has one container. The container manifest
specifies a CPU request of 500 millicpu and a CPU limit of 800 millicpu. These satisfy the
minimum and maximum CPU constraints imposed by the LimitRange for this namespace.

{{< codenew file="admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod.yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

Verify that the Pod is running and that its container is healthy:

```shell
kubectl get pod constraints-cpu-demo --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod constraints-cpu-demo --output=yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

The output shows that the Pod's only container has a CPU request of 500 millicpu and CPU limit
of 800 millicpu. These satisfy the constraints imposed by the LimitRange.

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 800m
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
```

## Delete the Pod

```shell
kubectl delete pod constraints-cpu-demo --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

## Attempt to create a Pod that exceeds the maximum CPU constraint

Here's a manifest for a Pod that has one container. The container specifies a
CPU request of 500 millicpu and a cpu limit of 1.5 cpu.

{{< codenew file="admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-2.yaml" >}}

Attempt to create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-2.yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

The output shows that the Pod does not get created, because it defines an unacceptable container.
That container is not acceptable because it specifies a CPU limit that is too large:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-2.yaml":
pods "constraints-cpu-demo-2" is forbidden: maximum cpu usage per Container is 800m, but limit is 1500m.
```

## Attempt to create a Pod that does not meet the minimum CPU request

Here's a manifest for a Pod that has one container. The container specifies a
CPU request of 100 millicpu and a CPU limit of 800 millicpu.

{{< codenew file="admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-3.yaml" >}}

Attempt to create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-3.yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

The output shows that the Pod does not get created, because it defines an unacceptable container.
That container is not acceptable because it specifies a CPU request that is lower than the
enforced minimum:

```
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-3.yaml":
pods "constraints-cpu-demo-3" is forbidden: minimum cpu usage per Container is 200m, but request is 100m.
```

## Create a Pod that does not specify any CPU request or limit

Here's a manifest for a Pod that has one container. The container does not
specify a CPU request, nor does it specify a CPU limit.

{{< codenew file="admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-4.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/resource/cpu-constraints-pod-4.yaml --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```
kubectl get pod constraints-cpu-demo-4 --namespace=constraints-cpu-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that the Pod's single container has a CPU request of 800 millicpu and a
CPU limit of 800 millicpu.
How did that container get those values?

```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 800m
  requests:
    cpu: 800m
```

Because that container did not specify its own CPU request and limit, the control plane
applied the
[default CPU request and limit](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/cpu-default-namespace/)
from the LimitRange for this namespace.

At this point, your Pod may or may not be running. Recall that a prerequisite for
this task is that your Nodes must have at least 1 CPU available for use. If each of your Nodes has only 1 CPU,
then there might not be enough allocatable CPU on any Node to accommodate a request of 800 millicpu. 
If you happen to be using Nodes with 2 CPU, then you probably have enough CPU to accommodate the 800 millicpu request.

Delete your Pod:

```
kubectl delete pod constraints-cpu-demo-4 --namespace=constraints-cpu-example
```

## Enforcement of minimum and maximum CPU constraints

The maximum and minimum CPU constraints imposed on a namespace by a LimitRange are enforced only
when a Pod is created or updated. If you change the LimitRange, it does not affect
Pods that were created previously.

## Motivation for minimum and maximum CPU constraints

As a cluster administrator, you might want to impose restrictions on the CPU resources that Pods can use.
For example:

* Each Node in a cluster has 2 CPU. You do not want to accept any Pod that requests
more than 2 CPU, because no Node in the cluster can support the request.

* A cluster is shared by your production and development departments.
You want to allow production workloads to consume up to 3 CPU, but you want development workloads to be limited
to 1 CPU. You create separate namespaces for production and development, and you apply CPU constraints to
each namespace.

## Clean up

Delete your namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace constraints-cpu-example
```
