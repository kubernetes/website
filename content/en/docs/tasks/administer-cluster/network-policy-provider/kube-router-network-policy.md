## Installing Kube-router addon
The Kube-router Addon comes with a Network Policy Controller that watches Kubernetes API server for any NetworkPolicy and pods updated and configures iptables rules and ipsets to allow or block traffic as directed by the policies. Please follow the [trying Kube-router with cluster installers](https://www.kube-router.io/docs/user-guide/#try-kube-router-with-cluster-installers) guide to install Kube-router addon.
