This page explains how to add Windows worker nodes to a kubeadm cluster.

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

* A running [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/windows-server-pricing)
(or higher) instance with administrative access.
* A running kubeadm cluster created by `kubeadm init` and following the steps
in the document [Creating a cluster with kubeadm](/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/).

<!-- steps -->

## Adding Windows worker nodes

{{< note >}}
To facilitate the addition of Windows worker nodes to a cluster, PowerShell scripts from the repository
https://sigs.k8s.io/sig-windows-tools are used.
{{< /note >}}

Do the following for each machine:

1. Open a PowerShell session on the machine.
1. Make sure you are Administrator or a privileged user.

Then proceed with the steps outlined below.

### Install containerd

{{% thirdparty-content %}}

To install containerd, first run the following command:

  ```PowerShell
  curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-windows-tools/master/hostprocess/Install-Containerd.ps1
  ``````

Then run the following command, but first replace `CONTAINERD_VERSION` with a recent release
from the [containerd repository](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases).
The version must not have a `v` prefix. For example, use `1.7.22` instead of `v1.7.22`:

  ```PowerShell
  .\Install-Containerd.ps1 -ContainerDVersion CONTAINERD_VERSION
  ```

* Adjust any other parameters for `Install-Containerd.ps1` such as `netAdapterName` as you need them.
* Set `skipHypervisorSupportCheck` if your machine does not support Hyper-V and cannot host Hyper-V isolated
containers.
* If you change the `Install-Containerd.ps1` optional parameters `CNIBinPath` and/or `CNIConfigPath` you will
need to configure the installed Windows CNI plugin with matching values.

### Install kubeadm and kubelet

Run the following commands to install kubeadm and the kubelet:

  ```PowerShell
  curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-windows-tools/master/hostprocess/PrepareNode.ps1
  .\PrepareNode.ps1 -KubernetesVersion v{{< skew currentVersion >}}
  ```

* Adjust the parameter `KubernetesVersion` of `PrepareNode.ps1` if needed.

### Run `kubeadm join`

Run the command that was output by `kubeadm init`. For example:

  ```bash
  kubeadm join --token <token> <control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
  ```

#### Additional information about kubeadm join

{{< note >}}
To specify an IPv6 tuple for `<control-plane-host>:<control-plane-port>`, IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets, for example: `[2001:db8::101]:2073`.
{{< /note >}}

If you do not have the token, you can get it by running the following command on the control plane node:

```bash
kubeadm token list
```

The output is similar to this:

```console
TOKEN                    TTL  EXPIRES              USAGES           DESCRIPTION            EXTRA GROUPS
8ewj1p.9r9hcjoqgajrj4gi  23h  2018-06-12T02:51:28Z authentication,  The default bootstrap  system:
                                                   signing          token generated by     bootstrappers:
                                                                    'kubeadm init'.        kubeadm:
                                                                                           default-node-token
```

By default, node join tokens expire after 24 hours. If you are joining a node to the cluster after the
current token has expired, you can create a new token by running the following command on the
control plane node:

```bash
kubeadm token create
```

The output is similar to this:

```console
5didvk.d09sbcov8ph2amjw
```

If you don't have the value of `--discovery-token-ca-cert-hash`, you can get it by running the
following commands on the control plane node:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt | openssl x509 -pubkey  | openssl rsa -pubin -outform der 2>/dev/null | \
   openssl dgst -sha256 -hex | sed 's/^.* //'
```

The output is similar to:

```console
8cb2de97839780a412b93877f8507ad6c94f73add17d5d7058e91741c9d5ec78
```

The output of the `kubeadm join` command should look something like:

```
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks

... (log output of join workflow) ...

Node join complete:
* Certificate signing request sent to control-plane and response
  received.
* Kubelet informed of new secure connection details.

Run 'kubectl get nodes' on control-plane to see this machine join.
```

A few seconds later, you should notice this node in the output from `kubectl get nodes`.
(for example, run `kubectl` on a  control plane node).

### Network configuration

CNI setup on clusters mixed with Linux and Windows nodes requires more steps than just
running `kubectl apply` on a manifest file. Additionally, the CNI plugin running on control
plane nodes must be prepared to support the CNI plugin running on Windows worker nodes.

{{% thirdparty-content %}}

Only a few CNI plugins currently support Windows. Below you can find individual setup instructions for them:
* [Flannel](https://sigs.k8s.io/sig-windows-tools/guides/flannel.md)
* [Calico](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/windows-calico/)

### Install kubectl for Windows (optional) {#install-kubectl}

See [Install and Set Up kubectl on Windows](/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/).
