<!-- overview -->

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.15" state="stable" >}}

Client certificates generated by [kubeadm](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/) expire after 1 year. This page explains how to manage certificate renewals with kubeadm.

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}


You should be familiar with [PKI certificates and requirements in Kubernetes](/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/).

<!-- steps -->

## Using custom certificates {#custom-certificates}

By default, kubeadm generates all the certificates needed for a cluster to run.
You can override this behavior by providing your own certificates.

To do so, you must place them in whatever directory is specified by the
`--cert-dir` flag or the `certificatesDir` field of kubeadm's `ClusterConfiguration`.
By default this is `/etc/kubernetes/pki`.

If a given certificate and private key pair exists before running `kubeadm init`,
kubeadm does not overwrite them. This means you can, for example, copy an existing
CA into `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt` and `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key`,
and kubeadm will use this CA for signing the rest of the certificates.

## External CA mode {#external-ca-mode}

It is also possible to provide only the `ca.crt` file and not the
`ca.key` file (this is only available for the root CA file, not other cert pairs).
If all other certificates and kubeconfig files are in place, kubeadm recognizes
this condition and activates the "External CA" mode. kubeadm will proceed without the
CA key on disk.

Instead, run the controller-manager standalone with `--controllers=csrsigner` and
point to the CA certificate and key.

[PKI certificates and requirements](/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/) includes guidance on
setting up a cluster to use an external CA.

## Check certificate expiration

You can use the `check-expiration` subcommand to check when certificates expire:

```
kubeadm certs check-expiration
```

The output is similar to this:

```

front-proxy-ca          Dec 28, 2029 23:36 UTC   9y              no
```

The command shows expiration/residual time for the client certificates in the `/etc/kubernetes/pki` folder and for the client certificate embedded in the KUBECONFIG files used by kubeadm (`admin.conf`, `controller-manager.conf` and `scheduler.conf`).

Additionally, kubeadm informs the user if the certificate is externally managed; in this case, the user should take care of managing certificate renewal manually/using other tools.

{{< warning >}}
`kubeadm` cannot manage certificates signed by an external CA.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< note >}}
`kubelet.conf` is not included in the list above because kubeadm configures kubelet for automatic certificate renewal.
{{< /note >}}

{{< warning >}}
On nodes created with `kubeadm init`, prior to kubeadm version 1.17, there is a
[bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1753) where you manually have to modify the contents of `kubelet.conf`. After `kubeadm init` finishes, you should update `kubelet.conf` to point to the
rotated kubelet client certificates, by replacing `client-certificate-data` and `client-key-data` with:

```yaml
client-certificate: /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
client-key: /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet-client-current.pem
```
{{< /warning >}}

## Automatic certificate renewal

kubeadm renews all the certificates during control plane [upgrade](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/).

This feature is designed for addressing the simplest use cases;
if you don't have specific requirements on certificate renewal and perform Kubernetes version upgrades regularly (less than 1 year in between each upgrade), kubeadm will take care of keeping your cluster up to date and reasonably secure.

{{< note >}}
It is a best practice to upgrade your cluster frequently in order to stay secure.
{{< /note >}}

If you have more complex requirements for certificate renewal, you can opt out from the default behavior by passing `--certificate-renewal=false` to `kubeadm upgrade apply` or to `kubeadm upgrade node`.

{{< warning >}}
Prior to kubeadm version 1.17 there is a [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm/issues/1818)
where the default value for `--certificate-renewal` is `false` for the `kubeadm upgrade node`
command. In that case, you should explicitly set `--certificate-renewal=true`.
{{< /warning >}}

## Manual certificate renewal

You can renew your certificates manually at any time with the `kubeadm certs renew` command.

This command performs the renewal using CA (or front-proxy-CA) certificate and key stored in `/etc/kubernetes/pki`.

{{< warning >}}
If you are running an HA cluster, this command needs to be executed on all the control-plane nodes.
{{< /warning >}}

{{< note >}}
`certs renew` uses the existing certificates as the authoritative source for attributes (Common Name, Organization, SAN, etc.) instead of the kubeadm-config ConfigMap. It is strongly recommended to keep them both in sync.
{{< /note >}}

`kubeadm certs renew` provides the following options:

The Kubernetes certificates normally reach their expiration date after one year.

- `--csr-only` can be used to renew certificates with an external CA by generating certificate signing requests (without actually renewing certificates in place); see next paragraph for more information.

- It's also possible to renew a single certificate instead of all.

## Renew certificates with the Kubernetes certificates API

This section provide more details about how to execute manual certificate renewal using the Kubernetes certificates API.

{{< caution >}}
These are advanced topics for users who need to integrate their organization's certificate infrastructure into a kubeadm-built cluster. If the default kubeadm configuration satisfies your needs, you should let kubeadm manage certificates instead.
{{< /caution >}}

### Set up a signer

The Kubernetes Certificate Authority does not work out of the box.
You can configure an external signer such as [cert-manager](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-ca.html), or you can use the built-in signer.

The built-in signer is part of [`kube-controller-manager`](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/).

To activate the built-in signer, you must pass the `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file` flags.

If you're creating a new cluster, you can use a kubeadm [configuration file](https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kubernetes/cmd/kubeadm/app/apis/kubeadm/v1beta2):

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterConfiguration
controllerManager:
  extraArgs:
    cluster-signing-cert-file: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    cluster-signing-key-file: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
```

### Create certificate signing requests (CSR)

See [Create CertificateSigningRequest](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#create-certificatesigningrequest) for creating CSRs with the Kubernetes API.

## Renew certificates with external CA

This section provide more details about how to execute manual certificate renewal using an external CA.

To better integrate with external CAs, kubeadm can also produce certificate signing requests (CSRs).
A CSR represents a request to a CA for a signed certificate for a client.
In kubeadm terms, any certificate that would normally be signed by an on-disk CA can be produced as a CSR instead. A CA, however, cannot be produced as a CSR.

### Create certificate signing requests (CSR)

You can create certificate signing requests with `kubeadm certs renew --csr-only`.

Both the CSR and the accompanying private key are given in the output.
You can pass in a directory with `--csr-dir` to output the CSRs to the specified location.
If `--csr-dir` is not specified, the default certificate directory (`/etc/kubernetes/pki`) is used.

Certificates can be renewed with `kubeadm certs renew --csr-only`.
As with `kubeadm init`, an output directory can be specified with the `--csr-dir` flag.

A CSR contains a certificate's name, domains, and IPs, but it does not specify usages.
It is the responsibility of the CA to specify [the correct cert usages](/docs/setup/best-practices/certificates/#all-certificates)
when issuing a certificate.

* In `openssl` this is done with the
  [`openssl ca` command](https://superuser.com/questions/738612/openssl-ca-keyusage-extension).
* In `cfssl` you specify
  [usages in the config file](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/blob/master/doc/cmd/cfssl.txt#L170).

After a certificate is signed using your preferred method, the certificate and the private key must be copied to the PKI directory (by default `/etc/kubernetes/pki`).

## Certificate authority (CA) rotation {#certificate-authority-rotation}

Kubeadm does not support rotation or replacement of CA certificates out of the box.

For more information about manual rotation or replacement of CA, see [manual rotation of CA certificates](/docs/tasks/tls/manual-rotation-of-ca-certificates/).

## Enabling signed kubelet serving certificates {#kubelet-serving-certs}

By default the kubelet serving certificate deployed by kubeadm is self-signed.
This means a connection from external services like the
[metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) to a
kubelet cannot be secured with TLS.

To configure the kubelets in a new kubeadm cluster to obtain properly signed serving
certificates you must pass the following minimal configuration to `kubeadm init`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterConfiguration
---
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
serverTLSBootstrap: true
```

If you have already created the cluster you must adapt it by doing the following:
 - Find and edit the `kubelet-config-{{< skew latestVersion >}}` ConfigMap in the `kube-system` namespace.
In that ConfigMap, the `kubelet` key has a
[KubeletConfiguration](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/#kubelet-config-k8s-io-v1beta1-KubeletConfiguration)
document as its value. Edit the KubeletConfiguration document to set `serverTLSBootstrap: true`.
- On each node, add the `serverTLSBootstrap: true` field in `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml`
and restart the kubelet with `systemctl restart kubelet`

The field `serverTLSBootstrap: true` will enable the bootstrap of kubelet serving
certificates by requesting them from the `certificates.k8s.io` API. One known limitation
is that the CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests) for these certificates cannot be automatically
approved by the default signer in the kube-controller-manager -
[`kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signers).
This will require action from the user or a third party controller.

These CSRs can be viewed using:

```shell
kubectl get csr
NAME        AGE     SIGNERNAME                        REQUESTOR                      CONDITION
csr-9wvgt   112s    kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving     system:node:worker-1           Pending
csr-lz97v   1m58s   kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving     system:node:control-plane-1    Pending
```

To approve them you can do the following:
```shell
kubectl certificate approve <CSR-name>
```

By default, these serving certificate will expire after one year. Kubeadm sets the
`KubeletConfiguration` field `rotateCertificates` to `true`, which means that close
to expiration a new set of CSRs for the serving certificates will be created and must
be approved to complete the rotation. To understand more see
[Certificate Rotation](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/#certificate-rotation).

If you are looking for a solution for automatic approval of these CSRs it is recommended
that you contact your cloud provider and ask if they have a CSR signer that verifies
the node identity with an out of band mechanism.

{{% thirdparty-content %}}

Third party custom controllers can be used:
- [kubelet-rubber-stamp](https://github.com/kontena/kubelet-rubber-stamp)

Such a controller is not a secure mechanism unless it not only verifies the CommonName
in the CSR but also verifies the requested IPs and domain names. This would prevent
a malicious actor that has access to a kubelet client certificate to create
CSRs requesting serving certificates for any IP or domain name.
