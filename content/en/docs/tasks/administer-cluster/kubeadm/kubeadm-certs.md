This page explains how to manage certificates manually with kubeadm.

{{% capture prerequisites %}}

These are advanced topics for users who need to integrate their organization's certificate infrastructure into a kubeadm-built cluster. If kubeadm with the default configuration satisfies your needs, you should let kubeadm manage certificates instead.

You should be familiar with [PKI certificates and requirements in Kubernetes](/docs/setup/certificates/).

## Renew certificates with the certificates API

Kubeadm can renew certificates with the `kubeadm alpha certs renew` commands.

Typically this is done by loading on-disk CA certificates and keys and using them to issue new certificates.
This approach works well if your certificate tree is self-contained. However, if your certificates are externally
managed, you might need a different approach.

As an alternative, Kubernetes provides its own [API for managing certificates][manage-tls].
With kubeadm, you can use this API by running `kubeadm alpha certs renew --use-api`.

## Set up a signer

The Kubernetes Certificate Authority does not work out of the box. 
You can configure an external signer such as [cert-manager][cert-manager-issuer], or you can use the build-in signer. 
The built-in signer is part of [`kube-controller-manager`][kcm]. 
To activate the build-in signer, you pass the `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and `--cluster-signing-key-file` arguments.

You pass these arguments in any of the following ways:

* Edit `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` to add the arguments to the command.
  Remember that your changes could be overwritten when you upgrade.

* If you're creating a new cluster, you can use a kubeadm [configuration file][config]:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta1
  kind: ClusterConfiguration
  controllerManager:
    extraArgs:
      cluster-signing-cert-file: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
      cluster-signing-key-file: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
  ```

* You can also upload a config file using [`kubeadm config upload from-files`][config-upload]

[config-upload]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm-config/#cmd-config-from-file

### Approve requests

If you set up an external signer such as [cert-manager][cert-manager], certificate signing requests (CSRs) are automatically approved.
Otherwise, you must manually approve certificates with the [`kubectl certificates`][certs] command. 
The following kubeadm command outputs the name of the certificate to approve, then blocks and waits for approval to occur:

```shell
$ sudo kubeadm alpha certs renew apiserver --use-api &
[1] 2890
[certs] certificate request "kubeadm-cert-kube-apiserver-ld526" created
$ kubectl certificate approve kubeadm-cert-kube-apiserver-ld526
certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/kubeadm-cert-kube-apiserver-ld526 approved
[1]+  Done                    sudo kubeadm alpha certs renew apiserver --use-api
```

You can view a list of pending certificates with `kubectl get csr`.

## Certificate requests with kubeadm

To better integrate with external CAs, kubeadm can also produce certificate signing requests (CSRs). 
A CSR represents a request to a CA for a signed certificate for a client. 
In kubeadm terms, any certificate that would normally be signed by an on-disk CA can be produced as a CSR instead. A CA, however, cannot be produced as a CSR.

You can create an individual CSR with `kubeadm init phase certs apiserver --use-csr`. 
The `--use-csr` flag can be applied only to individual phases. After [all certificates are in place][certs], you can run `kubeadm init --external-ca`.

You can pass in a directory with `--csr-dir` to output the CSRs to the specified location. 
If `--csr-dire` is not specified, the default certificate directory (`/etc/kubernetes/pki`) is used.
Both the CSR and the accompanying private key are given in the output. After a certificate is signed, the certificate and the private key must be copied to the PKI directory (by default `/etc/kubernetes/pki`).

### Renew certificates

Certificates can be renewed with `kubeadm alpha certs renew --use-csr`. 
As with `kubeadm init`, an output directory can be specified with the `--csr-dir` flag. 
To use the new certificates, copy the signed certificate and private key into the PKI directory (by default `/etc/kubernetes/pki`)

## Cert usage

A CSR contains a certificate's name, domains, and IPs, but it does not specify usages. 
It is the responsibility of the CA to specify [the correct cert usages][cert-table] when issuing a certificate.
 
* In `openssl` this is done with the [`openssl ca` command][openssl-ca].
* In `cfssl` you specify [usages in the config file][cfssl-usages]

## CA selection

Kubeadm sets up [three CAs][cert-cas] by default. Make sure to sign the CSRs with a corresponding CA.
