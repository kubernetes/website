title: Upgrading kubeadm clusters from v1.10 to v1.11
content_template: templates/task
---

{{% capture overview %}}

This page explains how to upgrade a Kubernetes cluster created with `kubeadm` from version 1.10.x to version 1.11.x, and from version 1.11.x to 1.11.y, where `y > x`.

{{% /capture %}}

{{% capture prerequisites %}}

- You need to have a `kubeadm` Kubernetes cluster running version 1.10.0 or later. Swap must be disabled. The cluster should use a static control plane and etcd pods.
- Make sure you read the [release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.11.md) carefully.
- Make sure to back up any important components, such as app-level state stored in a database. `kubeadm upgrade` does not touch your workloads, only components internal to Kubernetes, but backups are always a best practice.

### Additional information

- All containers are restarted after upgrade, because the container spec hash value is changed.
- You can upgrade only froom one minor version to the next minor version. That is, you cannot skip versions when you upgrade. For example, you can upgrade only from 1.10 to 1.11, not from 1.9 to 1.11.
- The default DNS provider in version 1.11 is [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) rather than [kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns).
To keep `kube-dns`, pass `--feature-flags=CoreDNS=false` to `kubeadm upgrade apply`.

## Upgrade the control plane

1.  On your master node, run the following (as root:

        export VERSION=$(curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt) # or manually specify a released Kubernetes version
        export ARCH=amd64 # or: arm, arm64, ppc64le, s390x
        curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/${ARCH}/kubeadm > /usr/bin/kubeadm
        chmod a+rx /usr/bin/kubeadm

    Note that upgrading the `kubeadm` package on your system prior to upgrading the control plane causes a failed upgrade. Even though `kubeadm` ships in the Kubernetes repositories, it's important to install it manually. The kubeadm team is working on fixing this limitation.

1.  Verify that the download works and has the expected version:

    ```shell
    kubeadm version
    ```

1.  On the master node, run:

    ```shell
    kubeadm upgrade plan
    ```

    You should see output similar to this:

    <!-- TODO: copy-paste actual output once new version is stable -->

    ```shell

    [upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.10.4
    [upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.11.0-beta.2.78+e0b33dbc2bde88

    Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
    COMPONENT   CURRENT       AVAILABLE
    Kubelet     1 x v1.10.4   v1.11.0

    Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.10 series:

    COMPONENT            CURRENT   AVAILABLE
    API Server           v1.10.4   v1.11.0
    Controller Manager   v1.10.4   v1.11.0
    Scheduler            v1.10.4   v1.11.0
    Kube Proxy           v1.10.4   v1.11.0
    CoreDNS                        1.1.3
    Kube DNS             1.14.8
    Etcd                 3.1.12    3.2.18

    You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

        kubeadm upgrade apply v1.11.0

    Note: Before you can perform this upgrade, you have to update kubeadm to v1.11.0.

    _____________________________________________________________________
    ```

    This command checks that your cluster can be upgraded, and fetches the versions you can upgrade to.

1.  Choose a version to upgrade to, and run the appropriate command. For example:

    ```shell
    kubeadm upgrade apply v1.11.0
    ```

    If you currently use `kube-dns` and wish to continue doing so, add `--feature-flags=CoreDNS=false`.

    You should see output similar to this:

    [upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.11.0-beta.2.78+e0b33dbc2bde88". Enjoy!

    [upgrade/kubelet] Now that your control plane is upgraded, please proceed with upgrading your kubelets if you haven't already done so.
    ```

1.  Manually upgrade your Software Defined Network (SDN).

    Your Container Network Interface (CNI) provider may have its own upgrade instructions to follow.
    Check the [addons](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/) page to
    find your CNI provider and see whther additional upgrade steps are required.

## Upgrade master and node packages

1.  Prepare each host for maintenance, marking it unschedulable and evicting the workload:

    ```shell
    kubectl drain $HOST --ignore-daemonsets
    ```

    On the master host, you must add `--ignore-daemonsets`:

    ```shell
    kubectl drain ip-172-31-85-18
    node "ip-172-31-85-18" cordoned
    error: unable to drain node "ip-172-31-85-18", aborting command...

    There are pending nodes to be drained:
    ip-172-31-85-18
    error: DaemonSet-managed pods (use --ignore-daemonsets to ignore): calico-node-5798d, kube-proxy-thjp9
    ```

    ```
    kubectl drain ip-172-31-85-18 --ignore-daemonsets
    node "ip-172-31-85-18" already cordoned
    WARNING: Ignoring DaemonSet-managed pods: calico-node-5798d, kube-proxy-thjp9
    node "ip-172-31-85-18" drained
    ```

1.  Upgrade the Kubernetes package version on each `$HOST` node by running the Linux package manager for your distribution:

    {{< tabs name="k8s_install" >}}
    {{% tab name="Ubuntu, Debian or HypriotOS" %}}
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade -y kubelet kubeadm
    {{% /tab %}}
    {{% tab name="CentOS, RHEL or Fedora" %}}
    yum upgrade -y kubelet kubedam
    {{% /tab %}}
    {{< /tabs >}}

## Upgrade kubelet on each node

1.  On each node except the master node, upgrade the kubelet config:

    ```shell
    sudo kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version $(kubelet --version | cut -d ' ' -f 2)
    ```

1.  Restart the kubectl process:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

1.  Verify that the new version of the `kubelet` is running on the host:

    ```shell
    systemctl status kubelet
    ```

1.  Bring the host back online by marking it schedulable:

    ```shell
    kubectl uncordon $HOST
    ```

1.  After the kubelet is upgraded on all hosts, verify that all nodes are available again by running the following command from anywhere -- for example, from outside the cluster:

    ```shell
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    The `STATUS` column should show `Ready` for all your hosts, and the version number should be updated.

## Recovering from a failure state

If `kubeadm upgrade` fails and does not roll back, for example because of an unexpected shutdown during execution,
you can run `kubeadm upgrade` again. This command is idempotent and eventually makes sure that the actual state is the desired state you declare.

To recover from a bad state, you can also run `kubeadm upgrade --force` without changing the version that your cluster is running.

## How it works

`kubeadm upgrade apply` does the following:

- Checks that your cluster is in an upgradeable state:
  - The API server is reachable,
  - All nodes are in the `Ready` state
  - The control plane is healthy
- Enforces the version skew policies.
- Makes sure the control plane images are available or available to pull to the machine.
- Upgrades the control plane components or rollbacks if any of them fails to come up.
- Applies the new `kube-dns` and `kube-proxy` manifests and enforces that all necessary RBAC rules are created.
- Creates new certificate and key files of the API server and backs up old files if they're about to expire in 180 days.
