### Create a simple Pod to use as a test environment

Create a file named dnsutils.yaml with the following contents:

{{< codenew file="admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml" >}}

Then create a pod using this file and verify its status:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml
pod/dnsutils created

kubectl get pods dnsutils
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dnsutils   1/1       Running   0          <some-time>
```

Once that pod is running, you can exec `nslookup` in that environment.
If you see something like the following, DNS is working correctly.

```shell
kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default
Server:    10.0.0.10
Address 1: 10.0.0.10

Name:      kubernetes.default
Address 1: 10.0.0.1
```

If the `nslookup` command fails, check the following:

### Check the local DNS configuration first

Take a look inside the resolv.conf file.
(See [Inheriting DNS from the node](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/#inheriting-dns-from-the-node) and
[Known issues](#known-issues) below for more information)

```shell
kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Verify that the search path and name server are set up like the following
(note that search path may vary for different cloud providers):

```
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local google.internal c.gce_project_id.internal
nameserver 10.0.0.10
options ndots:5
```

Errors such as the following indicate a problem with the coredns/kube-dns add-on or
associated Services:

```
kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default
Server:    10.0.0.10
Address 1: 10.0.0.10

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'
```

or

```
kubectl exec -ti dnsutils -- nslookup kubernetes.default
Server:    10.0.0.10
Address 1: 10.0.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

nslookup: can't resolve 'kubernetes.default'
```

### Check if the DNS pod is running

Use the `kubectl get pods` command to verify that the DNS pod is running.

For CoreDNS:
```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
coredns-7b96bf9f76-5hsxb   1/1       Running   0           1h
coredns-7b96bf9f76-mvmmt   1/1       Running   0           1h
...
```

Or for kube-dns:
```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns
NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
...
kube-dns-v19-ezo1y      3/3       Running   0           1h
...
```

If you see that no pod is running or that the pod has failed/completed, the DNS
add-on may not be deployed by default in your current environment and you will
have to deploy it manually.

### Check for Errors in the DNS pod

Use `kubectl logs` command to see logs for the DNS containers.

For CoreDNS:
```shell
for p in $(kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns -o name); do kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system $p; done
```

Here is an example of a healthy CoreDNS log:

```
.:53
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [INFO] CoreDNS-1.2.2
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [INFO] linux/amd64, go1.10.3, 2e322f6
CoreDNS-1.2.2
linux/amd64, go1.10.3, 2e322f6
2018/08/15 14:37:17 [INFO] plugin/reload: Running configuration MD5 = 24e6c59e83ce706f07bcc82c31b1ea1c
```


For kube-dns, there are 3 sets of logs:
```shell
kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system $(kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns -o name | head -1) -c kubedns

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system $(kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns -o name | head -1) -c dnsmasq

kubectl logs --namespace=kube-system $(kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns -o name | head -1) -c sidecar
```

See if there are any suspicious error messages in the logs. In kube-dns, a '`W`', '`E`' or '`F`' at the beginning
of a line represents a Warning, Error or Failure. Please search for entries that have these
as the logging level and use
[kubernetes issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues)
to report unexpected errors.

### Is DNS service up?

Verify that the DNS service is up by using the `kubectl get service` command.

```shell
kubectl get svc --namespace=kube-system
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
...
kube-dns     ClusterIP   10.0.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP        1h
...
```


Note that the service name will be "kube-dns" for both CoreDNS and kube-dns deployments.
If you have created the service or in the case it should be created by default
but it does not appear, see 
[debugging services](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-service/) for
more information.

### Are DNS endpoints exposed?

You can verify that DNS endpoints are exposed by using the `kubectl get endpoints`
command.

```shell
kubectl get ep kube-dns --namespace=kube-system
NAME       ENDPOINTS                       AGE
kube-dns   10.180.3.17:53,10.180.3.17:53    1h
```

If you do not see the endpoints, see endpoints section in the
[debugging services](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-service/) documentation.

For additional Kubernetes DNS examples, see the
[cluster-dns examples](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/cluster-dns)
in the Kubernetes GitHub repository.


### Are DNS queries being received/processed?

You can verify if queries are being received by CoreDNS by adding the `log` plugin to the CoreDNS configuration (aka Corefile).
The CoreDNS Corefile is held in a ConfigMap named `coredns`. To edit it, use the command ...

```
kubectl -n kube-system edit configmap coredns
```

Then add `log` in the Corefile section per the example below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        log
        errors
        health
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
          pods insecure
          upstream
          fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
        }
        prometheus :9153
        proxy . /etc/resolv.conf
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }

```

After saving the changes, it may take up to minute or two for Kubernetes to propagate these changes to the CoreDNS pods.

Next, make some queries and view the logs per the sections above in this document. If CoreDNS pods are receiving the queries, you should see them in the logs.

Here is an example of a query in the log.

```

```

## Known issues

Some Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) use a local DNS resolver by default (systemd-resolved).
Systemd-resolved moves and replaces `/etc/resolv.conf` with a stub file that can cause a fatal forwarding
loop when resolving names in upstream servers. This can be fixed manually by using kubelet's `--resolv-conf` flag
to point to the correct `resolv.conf` (With `systemd-resolved`, this is `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf`).
kubeadm (>= 1.11) automatically detects `systemd-resolved`, and adjusts the kubelet flags accordingly.

Kubernetes installs do not configure the nodes' `resolv.conf` files to use the
cluster DNS by default, because that process is inherently distribution-specific.
This should probably be implemented eventually.

Linux's libc (a.k.a. glibc) has a limit for the DNS `nameserver` records to 3 by default. What's more, for the glibc versions which are older than glibc-2.17-222 ([the new versions update see this issue](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/58028)), the allowed number of DNS `search` records has been limited to 6 ([see this bug from 2005](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=168253)). Kubernetes needs to consume 1 `nameserver` record and 3 `search` records. This means that if a local installation already uses 3 `nameserver`s or uses more than 3 `search`es while your glibc version is in the affected list, some of those settings will be lost. To work around the DNS `nameserver` records limit, the node can run `dnsmasq`, which will provide more `nameserver` entries. You can also use kubelet's `--resolv-conf` flag. To fix the DNS `search` records limit, consider upgrading your linux distribution or upgrading to an unaffected version of glibc.

If you are using Alpine version 3.3 or earlier as your base image, DNS may not
work properly due to a known issue with Alpine.
