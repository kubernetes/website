## Introduction

DNS is a built-in Kubernetes service launched automatically
using the _addon manager_
[cluster add-on](http://releases.k8s.io/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/cluster/addons/README.md).

As of Kubernetes v1.12, CoreDNS is the recommended DNS Server, replacing kube-dns. If your cluster
originally used kube-dns, you may still have `kube-dns` deployed rather than CoreDNS.

{{< note >}}
The CoreDNS Service is named `kube-dns` in the `metadata.name` field.  
This is so that there is greater interoperability with workloads that relied on the legacy `kube-dns` Service name to resolve addresses internal to the cluster. Using a Service named `kube-dns` abstracts away the implementation detail of which DNS provider is running behind that common name.
{{< /note >}}

If you are running CoreDNS as a Deployment, it will typically be exposed as a Kubernetes Service with a static IP address.
The kubelet passes DNS resolver information to each container with the `--cluster-dns=<dns-service-ip>` flag.

DNS names also need domains. You configure the local domain in the kubelet
with the flag `--cluster-domain=<default-local-domain>`.

The DNS server supports forward lookups (A and AAAA records), port lookups (SRV records), reverse IP address lookups (PTR records),
and more. For more information, see [DNS for Services and Pods](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).

If a Pod's `dnsPolicy` is set to `default`, it inherits the name resolution
configuration from the node that the Pod runs on. The Pod's DNS resolution
should behave the same as the node.
But see [Known issues](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-debugging-resolution/#known-issues).

If you don't want this, or if you want a different DNS config for pods, you can
use the kubelet's `--resolv-conf` flag.  Set this flag to "" to prevent Pods from
inheriting DNS. Set it to a valid file path to specify a file other than
`/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS inheritance.

## CoreDNS

CoreDNS is a general-purpose authoritative DNS server that can serve as cluster DNS, complying with the [dns specifications](https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md).

### CoreDNS ConfigMap options

CoreDNS is a DNS server that is modular and pluggable, and each plugin adds new functionality to CoreDNS.
This can be configured by maintaining a [Corefile](https://coredns.io/2017/07/23/corefile-explained/), which is the CoreDNS
configuration file. As a cluster administrator, you can modify the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="ConfigMap" term_id="configmap" >}} for the CoreDNS Corefile to change how DNS service discovery
behaves for that cluster.

In Kubernetes, CoreDNS is installed with the following default Corefile configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health {
            lameduck 5s
        }
        ready
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
            pods insecure
            fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
            ttl 30
        }
        prometheus :9153
        forward . /etc/resolv.conf
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
```

The Corefile configuration includes the following [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins/) of CoreDNS:

* [errors](https://coredns.io/plugins/errors/): Errors are logged to stdout.
* [health](https://coredns.io/plugins/health/): Health of CoreDNS is reported to `http://localhost:8080/health`. In this extended syntax `lameduck` will make the process unhealthy then wait for 5 seconds before the process is shut down.
* [ready](https://coredns.io/plugins/ready/): An HTTP endpoint on port 8181 will return 200 OK, when all plugins that are able to signal readiness have done so.
* [kubernetes](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/): CoreDNS will reply to DNS queries based on IP of the services and pods of Kubernetes. You can find [more details](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/) about that plugin on the CoreDNS website. `ttl` allows you to set a custom TTL for responses. The default is 5 seconds. The minimum TTL allowed is 0 seconds, and the maximum is capped at 3600 seconds. Setting TTL to 0 will prevent records from being cached.  
  The `pods insecure` option is provided for backward compatibility with _kube-dns_. You can use the `pods verified` option, which returns an A record only if there exists a pod in same namespace with matching IP. The `pods disabled` option can be used if you don't use pod records.
* [prometheus](https://coredns.io/plugins/metrics/): Metrics of CoreDNS are available at `http://localhost:9153/metrics` in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format (also known as OpenMetrics).
* [forward](https://coredns.io/plugins/forward/): Any queries that are not within the cluster domain of Kubernetes will be forwarded to predefined resolvers (/etc/resolv.conf).
* [cache](https://coredns.io/plugins/cache/): This enables a frontend cache.
* [loop](https://coredns.io/plugins/loop/): Detects simple forwarding loops and halts the CoreDNS process if a loop is found.
* [reload](https://coredns.io/plugins/reload): Allows automatic reload of a changed Corefile. After you edit the ConfigMap configuration, allow two minutes for your changes to take effect.
* [loadbalance](https://coredns.io/plugins/loadbalance): This is a round-robin DNS loadbalancer that randomizes the order of A, AAAA, and MX records in the answer.

You can modify the default CoreDNS behavior by modifying the ConfigMap.

### Configuration of Stub-domain and upstream nameserver using CoreDNS

CoreDNS has the ability to configure stubdomains and upstream nameservers using the [forward plugin](https://coredns.io/plugins/forward/).

#### Example
If a cluster operator has a [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) domain server located at 10.150.0.1, and all Consul names have the suffix .consul.local. To configure it in CoreDNS, the cluster administrator creates the following stanza in the CoreDNS ConfigMap.

```
consul.local:53 {
        errors
        cache 30
        forward . 10.150.0.1
    }
```

To explicitly force all non-cluster DNS lookups to go through a specific nameserver at 172.16.0.1, point the `forward` to the nameserver instead of `/etc/resolv.conf`

```
forward .  172.16.0.1
```

The final ConfigMap along with the default `Corefile` configuration looks like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: coredns
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  Corefile: |
    .:53 {
        errors
        health
        kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
           pods insecure
           fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
        }
        prometheus :9153
        forward . 172.16.0.1
        cache 30
        loop
        reload
        loadbalance
    }
    consul.local:53 {
        errors
        cache 30
        forward . 10.150.0.1
    }
```

The `kubeadm` tool supports automatic translation from the kube-dns ConfigMap
to the equivalent CoreDNS ConfigMap.

{{< note >}}
While kube-dns accepts an FQDN for stubdomain and nameserver (eg: ns.foo.com), CoreDNS does not support this feature.
During translation, all FQDN nameservers will be omitted from the CoreDNS config.
{{< /note >}}

## CoreDNS configuration equivalent to kube-dns

CoreDNS supports the features of kube-dns and more.
A ConfigMap created for kube-dns to support `StubDomains`and `upstreamNameservers` translates to the `forward` plugin in CoreDNS.

### Example

This example ConfigMap for kube-dns specifies stubdomains and upstreamnameservers:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  stubDomains: |
    {"abc.com" : ["1.2.3.4"], "my.cluster.local" : ["2.3.4.5"]}
  upstreamNameservers: |
    ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]
kind: ConfigMap
```

The equivalent configuration in CoreDNS creates a Corefile:

* For stubDomains:
```yaml
abc.com:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 1.2.3.4
}
my.cluster.local:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 2.3.4.5
}
```

The complete Corefile with the default plugins:

```
.:53 {
    errors
    health
    kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {
        pods insecure
        fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa
    }
    federation cluster.local {
        foo foo.feddomain.com
    }
    prometheus :9153
    forward . 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
    cache 30
}
abc.com:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 1.2.3.4
}
my.cluster.local:53 {
    errors
    cache 30
    forward . 2.3.4.5
}
```

## Migration to CoreDNS

To migrate from kube-dns to CoreDNS, a detailed
[blog article](https://coredns.io/2018/05/21/migration-from-kube-dns-to-coredns/)
is available to help users adapt CoreDNS in place of kube-dns.

You can also migrate using the official CoreDNS
[deploy script](https://github.com/coredns/deployment/blob/master/kubernetes/deploy.sh).
