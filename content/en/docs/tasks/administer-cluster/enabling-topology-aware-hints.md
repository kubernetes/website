<!-- overview -->
{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.21" state="alpha" >}}

_Topology Aware Hints_ enable topology aware routing with topology hints
included in {{< glossary_tooltip text="EndpointSlices" term_id="endpoint-slice" >}}.
This approach tries to keep traffic close to where it originated from;
you might do this to reduce costs, or to improve network performance.

  {{< include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" >}} {{< version-check >}}

The following prerequisite is needed in order to enable topology aware hints:

* Configure the {{< glossary_tooltip text="kube-proxy" term_id="kube-proxy" >}} to run in
  iptables mode or IPVS mode
* Ensure that you have not disabled EndpointSlices

## Enable Topology Aware Hints

To enable service topology hints, enable the `TopologyAwareHints` [feature
gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) for the
kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-proxy:

```
--feature-gates="TopologyAwareHints=true"
```
