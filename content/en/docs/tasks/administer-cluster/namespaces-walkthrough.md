<!-- overview -->
Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="namespaces" term_id="namespace" >}}
help different projects, teams, or customers to share a Kubernetes cluster.

It does this by providing the following:

1. A scope for [Names](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/).
2. A mechanism to attach authorization and policy to a subsection of the cluster.

Use of multiple namespaces is optional.

This example demonstrates how to use Kubernetes namespaces to subdivide your cluster.

## Prerequisites

This example assumes the following:

1. You have an [existing Kubernetes cluster](/docs/setup/).
2. You have a basic understanding of Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}}, {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="Services" >}}, and {{< glossary_tooltip text="Deployments" term_id="deployment" >}}.

## Understand the default namespace

By default, a Kubernetes cluster will instantiate a default namespace when provisioning the cluster to hold the default set of Pods,
Services, and Deployments used by the cluster.

Assuming you have a fresh cluster, you can inspect the available namespaces by doing the following:

```shell
kubectl get namespaces
```
```
NAME      STATUS    AGE
default   Active    13m
```

## Create new namespaces

For this exercise, we will create two additional Kubernetes namespaces to hold our content.

Let's imagine a scenario where an organization is using a shared Kubernetes cluster for development and production use cases.

The development team would like to maintain a space in the cluster where they can get a view on the list of Pods, Services, and Deployments
they use to build and run their application.  In this space, Kubernetes resources come and go, and the restrictions on who can or cannot modify resources
are relaxed to enable agile development.

The operations team would like to maintain a space in the cluster where they can enforce strict procedures on who can or cannot manipulate the set of
Pods, Services, and Deployments that run the production site.

One pattern this organization could follow is to partition the Kubernetes cluster into two namespaces: `development` and `production`.

Let's create two new namespaces to hold our work.

Use the file [`namespace-dev.json`](/examples/admin/namespace-dev.json) which describes a `development` namespace:

{{< codenew language="json" file="admin/namespace-dev.json" >}}

Create the `development` namespace using kubectl.

```shell
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/namespace-dev.json
```

Save the following contents into file [`namespace-prod.json`](/examples/admin/namespace-prod.json) which describes a `production` namespace:

{{< codenew language="json" file="admin/namespace-prod.json" >}}

And then let's create the `production` namespace using kubectl.

```shell
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/namespace-prod.json
```

To be sure things are right, let's list all of the namespaces in our cluster.

```shell
kubectl get namespaces --show-labels
```
```
NAME          STATUS    AGE       LABELS
default       Active    32m       <none>
development   Active    29s       name=development
production    Active    23s       name=production
```

## Create pods in each namespace

A Kubernetes namespace provides the scope for Pods, Services, and Deployments in the cluster.

Users interacting with one namespace do not see the content in another namespace.

To demonstrate this, let's spin up a simple Deployment and Pods in the `development` namespace.

We first check what is the current context:

```shell
kubectl config view
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: REDACTED
    server: https://130.211.122.180
  name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
    user: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
current-context: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
    token: 65rZW78y8HbwXXtSXuUw9DbP4FLjHi4b
- name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes-basic-auth
  user:
    password: h5M0FtUUIflBSdI7
    username: admin
```
```shell
kubectl config current-context
```
```
lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
```

The next step is to define a context for the kubectl client to work in each namespace. The value of "cluster" and "user" fields are copied from the current context.

```shell
kubectl config set-context dev --namespace=development \
  --cluster=lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes \
  --user=lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes

kubectl config set-context prod --namespace=production \
  --cluster=lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes \
  --user=lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
```

By default, the above commands adds two contexts that are saved into file
`.kube/config`. You can now view the contexts and alternate against the two
new request contexts depending on which namespace you wish to work against.

To view the new contexts:

```shell
kubectl config view
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: REDACTED
    server: https://130.211.122.180
  name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
    user: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
- context:
    cluster: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
    namespace: development
    user: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  name: dev
- context:
    cluster: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
    namespace: production
    user: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  name: prod
current-context: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
    token: 65rZW78y8HbwXXtSXuUw9DbP4FLjHi4b
- name: lithe-cocoa-92103_kubernetes-basic-auth
  user:
    password: h5M0FtUUIflBSdI7
    username: admin
```

Let's switch to operate in the `development` namespace.

```shell
kubectl config use-context dev
```

You can verify your current context by doing the following:

```shell
kubectl config current-context
```
```
dev
```

At this point, all requests we make to the Kubernetes cluster from the command line are scoped to the `development` namespace.

Let's create some contents.

{{< codenew file="admin/snowflake-deployment.yaml" >}}

Apply the manifest to create a Deployment 

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/snowflake-deployment.yaml
```
We have created a deployment whose replica size is 2 that is running the pod called `snowflake` with a basic container that serves the hostname.

```shell
kubectl get deployment
```
```
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
snowflake    2/2     2            2           2m
```

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=snowflake
```
```
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
snowflake-3968820950-9dgr8   1/1       Running   0          2m
snowflake-3968820950-vgc4n   1/1       Running   0          2m
```

And this is great, developers are able to do what they want, and they do not have to worry about affecting content in the `production` namespace.

Let's switch to the `production` namespace and show how resources in one namespace are hidden from the other.

```shell
kubectl config use-context prod
```

The `production` namespace should be empty, and the following commands should return nothing.

```shell
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pods
```

Production likes to run cattle, so let's create some cattle pods.

```shell
kubectl create deployment cattle --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname --replicas=5

kubectl get deployment
```
```
NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cattle       5/5     5            5           10s
```

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=cattle
```
```
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cattle-2263376956-41xy6   1/1       Running   0          34s
cattle-2263376956-kw466   1/1       Running   0          34s
cattle-2263376956-n4v97   1/1       Running   0          34s
cattle-2263376956-p5p3i   1/1       Running   0          34s
cattle-2263376956-sxpth   1/1       Running   0          34s
```

At this point, it should be clear that the resources users create in one namespace are hidden from the other namespace.

As the policy support in Kubernetes evolves, we will extend this scenario to show how you can provide different
authorization rules for each namespace.
