<!-- overview -->

This section presents information you need to know when migrating from
dockershim to other container runtimes.

Since the announcement of [dockershim deprecation](/blog/2020/12/08/kubernetes-1-20-release-announcement/#dockershim-deprecation)
in Kubernetes 1.20, there were questions on how this will affect various workloads and Kubernetes
installations. Our [Dockershim Removal FAQ](/blog/2022/02/17/dockershim-faq/) is there to help you
to understand the problem better.

Dockershim was removed from Kubernetes with the release of v1.24.
If you use Docker via dockershim as your container runtime, and wish to upgrade to v1.24,
it is recommended that you either migrate to another runtime or find an alternative means to obtain Docker Engine support.
Check out [container runtimes](/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/)
section to know your options. Make sure to
[report issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues) you encountered
with the migration. So the issue can be fixed in a timely manner and your cluster would be
ready for dockershim removal.
