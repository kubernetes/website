<!-- overview -->

With Kubernetes 1.20 dockershim was deprecated. From the
[Dockershim Deprecation FAQ](/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/)
you might already know that most apps do not have a direct dependency on runtime hosting
containers. However, there are still a lot of telemetry and security agents
that has a dependency on docker to collect containers metadata, logs and
metrics. This document aggregates information on how to detect these
dependencies and links on how to migrate these agents to use generic tools or
alternative runtimes.

## Telemetry and security agents

There are a few ways agents may run on Kubernetes cluster. Agents may run on
nodes directly or as DaemonSets.

### Why do telemetry agents rely on Docker?

Historically, Kubernetes was built on top of Docker. Kubernetes is managing
networking and scheduling, Docker was placing and operating containers on a
node. So you can get scheduling-related metadata like a pod name from Kubernetes
and containers state information from Docker. Over time more runtimes were
created to manage containers. Also there are projects and Kubernetes features
that generalize container status information extraction across many runtimes.

Some agents are tied specifically to the Docker tool. The agents may run
commands like [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)
or [`docker top`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top/) to list
containers and processes or [docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)
to subscribe on docker logs. With the deprecating of Docker as a container runtime,
these commands will not work any longer.

### Identify DaemonSets that depend on Docker {#identify-docker-dependency}

If a pod wants to make calls to the `dockerd` running on the node, the pod must either:

- mount the filesystem containing the Docker daemon's privileged socket, as a
  {{< glossary_tooltip text="volume" term_id="volume" >}}; or
- mount the specific path of the Docker daemon's privileged socket directly, also as a volume.

For example: on COS images, Docker exposes its Unix domain socket at
`/var/run/docker.sock` This means that the pod spec will include a
`hostPath` volume mount of `/var/run/docker.sock`.

Here's a sample shell script to find Pods that have a mount directly mapping the
Docker socket. This script outputs the namespace and name of the pod. You can
remove the grep `/var/run/docker.sock` to review other mounts.

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces \
-o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.namespace}{":\t"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.volumes[*]}{.hostPath.path}{", "}{end}{end}' \
| sort \
| grep '/var/run/docker.sock'
```

{{< note >}}
There are alternative ways for a pod to access Docker on the host. For instance, the parent
directory `/var/run` may be mounted instead of the full path (like in [this
example](https://gist.github.com/itaysk/7bc3e56d69c4d72a549286d98fd557dd)).
The script above only detects the most common uses.

### Detecting Docker dependency from node agents

In case your cluster nodes are customized and install additional security and
telemetry agents on the node, make sure to check with the vendor of the agent whether it has dependency on Docker.

### Telemetry and security agent vendors

We keep the work in progress version of migration instructions for various telemetry and security agent vendors
in [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFi4uKit63ga5sxEiZblfb-c23lFhvy6RXVPikS8wf0/edit#).
Please contact the vendor to get up to date instructions for migrating from dockershim.
