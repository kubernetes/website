This page shows you how to migrate your Docker Engine nodes to use `cri-dockerd`
instead of dockershim. Follow these steps if your clusters run Kubernetes 1.23
or earlier and you want to continue using Docker Engine after
you upgrade to Kubernetes 1.24 and later, or if you just want to move off the
dockershim component.

## What is cri-dockerd? {#what-is-cri-dockerd}

In Kubernetes 1.23 and earlier, Docker Engine used a component called the
dockershim to interact with Kubernetes system components such as the kubelet.
The dockershim component is deprecated and will be removed in Kubernetes 1.24. A
third-party replacement, `cri-dockerd`, is available. The `cri-dockerd` adapter
lets you use Docker Engine through the {{<glossary_tooltip term_id="cri" text="Container Runtime Interface">}}.

{{<note>}}
If you already use `cri-dockerd`, you aren't affected by the dockershim removal.
Before you begin, [Check whether your nodes use the dockershim](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/find-out-runtime-you-use/).
{{</note>}}

If you want to migrate to `cri-dockerd` so that you can continue using Docker
Engine as your container runtime, you should do the following for each affected
node: 

1.  Install `cri-dockerd`.
1.  Cordon and drain the node.
1.  Configure the kubelet to use `cri-dockerd`. 
1.  Restart the kubelet.
1.  Verify that the node is healthy.

Test the migration on non-critical nodes first.

You should perform the following steps for each node that you want to migrate
to `cri-dockerd`.

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

*   [`cri-dockerd`](https://github.com/mirantis/cri-dockerd#build-and-install)
    installed and started on each node.
*   A [network plugin](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/).

## Cordon and drain the node

1.  Cordon the node to stop new Pods scheduling on it:

    ```shell
    kubectl cordon <NODE_NAME>
    ```
    Replace `<NODE_NAME>` with the name of the node.

1.  Drain the node to safely evict running Pods: 

    ```shell
    kubectl drain <NODE_NAME> \
        --ignore-daemonsets
    ```

## Configure the kubelet to use cri-dockerd

The following steps apply to clusters set up using the kubeadm tool. If you use
a different tool, you should modify the kubelet using the configuration
instructions for that tool.

1.  Open `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env` on each affected node.
1.  Modify the `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag to
    `unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.

The kubeadm tool stores the node's socket as an annotation on the `Node` object
in the control plane. To modify this socket for each affected node:  

1.  Edit the YAML representation of the `Node` object:

    ```shell
    KUBECONFIG=/path/to/admin.conf kubectl edit no <NODE_NAME>
    ```
    Replace the following:
    
    *   `/path/to/admin.conf`: the path to the kubectl configuration file,
        `admin.conf`.
    *   `<NODE_NAME>`: the name of the node you want to modify.

1.  Change `kubeadm.alpha.kubernetes.io/cri-socket` from
    `/var/run/dockershim.sock` to `unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.
1.  Save the changes. The `Node` object is updated on save.

## Restart the kubelet

```shell
systemctl restart kubelet
```

## Verify that the node is healthy

To check whether the node uses the `cri-dockerd` endpoint, follow the
instructions in [Find out which runtime you use](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/find-out-runtime-you-use/).
The `--container-runtime-endpoint` flag for the kubelet should be `unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock`.

## Uncordon the node

Uncordon the node to let Pods schedule on it: 

```shell
kubectl uncordon <NODE_NAME>
```
