{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="MemoryManager" >}}

The Kubernetes *Memory Manager* enables the feature of guaranteed memory (and hugepages)
allocation for pods in the `Guaranteed` {{< glossary_tooltip text="QoS class" term_id="qos-class" >}}.

The Memory Manager employs a hint generation protocol to yield the most suitable NUMA affinity for a pod.
The Memory Manager feeds the central manager (*Topology Manager*) with these affinity hints.
Based on both the hints and Topology Manager policy, the pod is rejected or admitted to the node.

Moreover, the Memory Manager ensures that the memory which a pod requests
is allocated from a minimum number of NUMA nodes.

For background about memory resources for Pods, read
[Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/).

### Resource alignment prerequisites

To align memory resources with other requested resources in a Pod spec:

- the CPU Manager should be enabled and proper CPU Manager policy should be configured on a Node.
  See [control CPU Management Policies](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cpu-management-policies/);
- the Topology Manager should be enabled and proper Topology Manager policy should be configured on a Node.
  See [control Topology Management Policies](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/).

### Windows support

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="WindowsCPUAndMemoryAffinity" >}}

Windows support can be enabled via the `WindowsCPUAndMemoryAffinity` feature gate
and it requires support in the container runtime.  
Only the [None](#policy-none) and [BestEffort](#policy-best-effort) policies are supported on Windows.

## How does the Memory Manager operate?

For Linux nodes, the Memory Manager offers the guaranteed memory (and hugepages) allocation
for Pods in Guaranteed QoS class.
To immediately put the Memory Manager into operation follow the guidelines in the section
[Memory Manager configuration](#memory-manager-configuration), and subsequently,
prepare and deploy a `Guaranteed` Pod as illustrated in the section
[Placing a Pod in the Guaranteed QoS class](#placing-a-pod-in-the-guaranteed-qos-class).

The Memory Manager is a hint provider, and it provides topology hints for
the Topology Manager which then aligns the requested resources according to these topology hints.
On Linux, it also enforces `cgroups` (specifically, `cpuset.mems`) for Pods.
The complete flow diagram concerning pod admission and deployment process is illustrated
below:

![Memory Manager in the pod admission and deployment process](/images/docs/memory-manager-diagram.svg)

During this process, the Memory Manager updates its internal counters stored in
[Node Map and Memory Maps][2] to manage guaranteed memory allocation.

The memory manager activates during kubelet startup if a node administrator configures
`reservedMemory` for the kubelet (section [Reserved memory configuration](#reserved-memory-flag)).
In this case, the kubelet updates its node map to reflect this reservation.

When the `Static` policy is configured, you **must** configure reserved memory for the node
(for example, with the `reservedMemory` configuration field in the kubelet configuration).

An important topic in the context of Memory Manager operation is the management of NUMA groups.
Each time pod's memory request is in excess of single NUMA node capacity, the Memory Manager
attempts to create a group that comprises several NUMA nodes and that features extended memory
capacity.

## Memory Manager configuration

Other Managers should already be configured (see [resource alignment prerequisites](#resource-alignment-prerequisites).
Set the `memoryManagerPolicy` configuration field within the [kubelet configuration]({{< relref "/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1" >}}), to the name of your chosen [policy](#policies).

Optionally, some amount of memory can be reserved for system or kubelet processes to increase
node stability (section [Reserved memory configuration](#reserved-memory-flag)).

### Policies

Kubernetes' memory manager provides three policies. You can select a policy via the `memoryManagerPolicy` configuration field
in the kubelet configuration; the values available in Kubernetes {{< skew currentVersion >}} are:

* [`None`](#policy-none) (default)
* [`Static`](#policy-static) (Linux only)
* [`BestEffort`](#policy-best-effort) (Windows only)

#### None policy {#policy-none}

This is the default policy and does not affect the memory allocation in any way.
It acts the same as if the Memory Manager is not present at all.

The `None` policy returns default topology hint. This special hint denotes that Hint Provider
(Memory Manager in this case) has no preference for NUMA affinity with any resource.

#### Static policy {#policy-static}

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="MemoryManager" >}}

**This policy is only supported on Linux.**

In the case of the `Guaranteed` pod, the `Static` Memory Manager policy returns topology hints
relating to the set of NUMA nodes where the memory can be guaranteed,
and reserves the memory through updating the internal [NodeMap][2] object.

In the case of the `BestEffort` or `Burstable` pod, the `Static` Memory Manager policy sends back
the default topology hint as there is no request for the guaranteed memory,
and does not reserve the memory in the internal [NodeMap][2] object.

This policy is only supported on Linux.

#### BestEffort policy {#policy-best-effort}

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="WindowsCPUAndMemoryAffinity" >}}

**This policy is only supported on Windows.**

On Windows, NUMA node assignment works differently than Linux.
There is no mechanism to ensure that Memory access only comes from a specific NUMA node.
Instead the Windows operating system scheduler selects the most optimal NUMA node based on the CPU(s) assignments.
It is possible that Windows might use other NUMA nodes if the Windows scheduler deems them optimal.

The policy does track the amount of memory available and requested through the internal _node map_.
The memory manager makes a best effort at ensuring that enough memory is available on a NUMA node before making
a resource assignment.  
This means that in most cases memory assignment should function as specified.

## Reserved memory configuration {#reserved-memory-flag}

As an administrator, you can configure the total amount of reserved memory
for a node. This pre-configured value is subsequently utilized to calculate
the real amount of [node allocatable](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable) memory available to pods.

The Kubernetes scheduler incorporates allocatable memory information to optimise pod
[scheduling](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/).
. The _node allocatable_ mechanism is commonly used by node administrators to reserve K8s node
system resources for the kubelet or operating system processes to help assure node stability.

The relevant kubelet settings include `kubeReserved`, `systemReserved` and `reservedMemory`.
The `reservedMemory` setting allows you to split the total reserved memory and assign it
across many NUMA nodes.

You specify a comma-separated list of memory reservations, of different
memory types, per NUMA node.
You can also specify reservations that span multiple NUMA nodes, using a semicolon as separator.

The Memory Manager will not use this reserved memory for running container workloads.

For example, if you have a NUMA node "NUMA0" with 10GiB of memory available, and
you configure `reservedMemory`  to reserve `1Gi` (of memory) for NUMA0,
the Memory Manager assumes that only 9GiB is available for pods.

You can omit this parameter, however, you should be aware that the quantity of reserved memory
from all NUMA nodes should be equal to the quantity of _node allocatable_ memory.

If at least one node allocatable parameter is non-zero, you will need to specify
`reservedMemory` for at least one NUMA node.
In fact, the `evictionHard` threshold value is equal to `100Mi` by default, so
if you use the `Static` policy, specifying `reservedMemory` is obligatory.

### Memory manager reserved memory syntax {#reserved-memory-syntax}

Here are some examples of how to set the `reservedMemory` configuration for the kubelet.

```yaml
  # Example 1
  reservedMemory:
  - numaNode: 0 # NUMA node index
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi" # byte quantity
  - numaNode: 1
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi" # byte quantity
```

```yaml
  # Example 2
  reservedMemory:
  - numaNode: 0
    limits:
      "memory": "512Gi"
  - numaNode: 1
    limits:
      "memory": "512Gi"
      "hugepages-1Gi": "2Gi" # only relevant on Linux
```

### Constraints on NUMA memory reservation

When you specify values for `reservedMemory`, this must be compatible with the `kubeReserved`
and `systemReserved` values that are in effect, along with any `memory.available` setting
you make as part of `evictionHard`.

```math
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{ \textnormal{i} = 0}^{ \textnormal{node count}} { \textit{reservedMemory} [ \textnormal{i} ]} = \textit{kubeReserved} + \textit{systemReserved} + \textit{evictionHard} \, \boxed{\textnormal{memory.available}}
\end{equation*}  \tag*{where i is an index of a NUMA node}
```

If you do not follow the formula above, the Memory Manager will show an error on startup.

In other words, the example 1 (above) illustrates that for the conventional memory (`type=memory`),
Kubernetes reserves 3GiB in total; that is:

```math
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{ \textnormal{i} = 0}^{ \textnormal{node count}} \textit{reservedMemory}_{ [ \textnormal{i} ] }  =  \underbrace{\textit{reservedMemory} [ 0 ] + \textit{reservedMemory} [ 1 ] }_{\textnormal{type=memory}}
            = 1 \textnormal{GiB} + 2 \textnormal{GiB}
            = 3 \textnormal{GiB}
\end{equation*}
```

Some examples of kubelet configuration settings relevant to the node allocatable configuration:

```yaml
  kubeReserved: { cpu: "500m", memory: "50Mi" } # half a CPU, 50MiB of memory
  systemReserved: { cpu: "500m", memory: "256Mi" } # half a CPU, 256MiB of memory
```

{{< note >}}
The default hard eviction threshold is 100MiB, and **not** zero.
Remember to increase the quantity of memory that you reserve by setting `reservedMemory`
by that hard eviction threshold. Otherwise, the kubelet will not start Memory Manager and
display an error.

Here is an example of a correct configuration that uses `reservedMemory`:
```yaml
  # this snippet relies on the default value of evictionHard
  memoryManagerPolicy: Static
  kubeReserved: { cpu: "4", memory: "4Gi" }
  systemReserved: { cpu: "1", memory: "1Gi" }
  reservedMemory:
  - numaNode: 0
    limits:
      memory: "3Gi"
  - numaNode: 1
    limits:
      memory: "2148Mi" # 3GiB minus 100MiB
```
{{< /note >}}

### Configurations to avoid {#reserved-memory-configurations-to-avoid}

Avoid the following configurations:

1. duplicates: the same NUMA node or memory type, but with a different value;
1. setting a zero limit for any of memory types;
1. NUMA node IDs that do not exist in the machine hardware;
1. memory type names different than `memory` or `hugepages-<size>`
   (hugepages of particular `<size>` should also exist).

## Placing a Pod in the Guaranteed QoS class

If the selected policy is anything other than `None`, the Memory Manager identifies pods
that are in the `Guaranteed` QoS class.
The Memory Manager provides specific topology hints to the Topology Manager for each `Guaranteed` pod.
For pods in a QoS class other than `Guaranteed`, the Memory Manager provides default topology hints
to the Topology Manager.

The following excerpts from pod manifests assign a pod to the `Guaranteed` QoS class.

A Pod with integer CPU(s) runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class, when `requests` are equal to `limits`:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
        example.com/device: "1"
```

Also, a pod sharing CPU(s) runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class, when `requests` are equal to `limits`.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "300m"
        example.com/device: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "300m"
        example.com/device: "1"
```

Notice that both CPU and memory requests must be specified for a Pod to lend it to Guaranteed QoS class.
