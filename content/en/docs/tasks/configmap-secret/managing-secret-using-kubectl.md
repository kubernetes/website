<!-- overview -->

This page shows you how to create, edit, manage, and delete Kubernetes
{{<glossary_tooltip text="Secrets" term_id="secret">}} using the `kubectl`
command-line tool.

## Create a Secret

A `Secret` object stores sensitive data such as credentials
used by Pods to access services. For example, you might need a Secret to store
the username and password needed to access a database.

You can create the Secret by passing the raw data in the command, or by storing
the credentials in files that you pass in the command. The following commands
create a Secret that stores the username `admin` and the password `S!B\*d$zDsb=`.

### Use raw data

Run the following command:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
    --from-literal=username=admin \
    --from-literal=password='S!B\*d$zDsb='
```
You must use single quotes `''` to escape special characters such as `$`, `\`,
`*`, `=`, and `!` in your strings. If you don't, your shell will interpret these
characters.

{{< note >}}
The `stringData` field for a Secret does not work well with server-side apply.
{{< /note >}}

### Use source files

1. Store the credentials in files:

   ```shell
   echo -n 'admin' > ./username.txt
   echo -n 'S!B\*d$zDsb=' > ./password.txt
   ```

   The `-n` flag ensures that the generated files do not have an extra newline
   character at the end of the text. This is important because when `kubectl`
   reads a file and encodes the content into a base64 string, the extra
   newline character gets encoded too. You do not need to escape special
   characters in strings that you include in a file.

1. Pass the file paths in the `kubectl` command:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
       --from-file=./username.txt \
       --from-file=./password.txt
   ```

   The default key name is the file name. You can optionally set the key name
   using `--from-file=[key=]source`. For example:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass \
       --from-file=username=./username.txt \
       --from-file=password=./password.txt
   ```

With either method, the output is similar to:

```
secret/db-user-pass created
```

### Verify the Secret {#verify-the-secret}

Check that the Secret was created:

```shell
kubectl get secrets
```

The output is similar to:

```
NAME              TYPE       DATA      AGE
db-user-pass      Opaque     2         51s
```

View the details of the Secret:

```shell
kubectl describe secret db-user-pass
```

The output is similar to:

```
Name:            db-user-pass
Namespace:       default
Labels:          <none>
Annotations:     <none>

Type:            Opaque

Data
====
password:    12 bytes
username:    5 bytes
```

The commands `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` avoid showing the contents
of a `Secret` by default. This is to protect the `Secret` from being exposed
accidentally, or from being stored in a terminal log.

### Decode the Secret  {#decoding-secret}

1. View the contents of the Secret you created:

   ```shell
   kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data}'
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```json
   { "password": "UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9", "username": "YWRtaW4=" }
   ```

1. Decode the `password` data:

   ```shell
   echo 'UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9' | base64 --decode
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   S!B\*d$zDsb=
   ```

   {{< caution >}}
   This is an example for documentation purposes. In practice,
   this method could cause the command with the encoded data to be stored in
   your shell history. Anyone with access to your computer could find the
   command and decode the secret. A better approach is to combine the view and
   decode commands.
   {{< /caution >}}

   ```shell
   kubectl get secret db-user-pass -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
   ```

## Edit a Secret {#edit-secret}

You can edit an existing `Secret` object unless it is
[immutable](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-immutable). To edit a
Secret, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl edit secrets <secret-name>
```

This opens your default editor and allows you to update the base64 encoded
Secret values in the `data` field, such as in the following example:

```yaml
# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file, it will be
# reopened with the relevant failures.
#
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-06-28T17:44:13Z"
  name: db-user-pass
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "12708504"
  uid: 91becd59-78fa-4c85-823f-6d44436242ac
type: Opaque
```

## Clean up

To delete a Secret, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl delete secret db-user-pass
```
