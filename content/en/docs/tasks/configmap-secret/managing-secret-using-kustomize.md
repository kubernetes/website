<!-- overview -->

`kubectl` supports using the [Kustomize object management tool](/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/) to manage Secrets
and ConfigMaps. You create a *resource generator* using Kustomize, which
generates a Secret that you can apply to the API server using `kubectl`.

<!-- steps -->

## Create a Secret

You can generate a Secret by defining a `secretGenerator` in a
`kustomization.yaml` file that references other existing files, `.env` files, or
literal values. For example, the following instructions create a Kustomization
file for the username `admin` and the password `1f2d1e2e67df`.

The `stringData` field for a Secret does not work well with server-side apply.

### Create the Kustomization file

{{< tabs name="Secret data" >}}
{{< tab name="Literals" codelang="yaml" >}}
secretGenerator:
- name: database-creds
  literals:
  - username=admin
  - password=1f2d1e2e67df
{{< /tab >}}
{{% tab name="Files" %}}
1.  Store the credentials in files. The filenames are the keys of the secret:

    ```shell
    echo -n 'admin' > ./username.txt
    echo -n '1f2d1e2e67df' > ./password.txt
    ```
    The `-n` flag ensures that there's no newline character at the end of your
    files.

1.  Create the `kustomization.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    secretGenerator:
    - name: database-creds
      files:
      - username.txt
      - password.txt
    ```
{{% /tab %}}}
{{% tab name=".env files" %}}
You can also define the secretGenerator in the `kustomization.yaml` file by
providing `.env` files. For example, the following `kustomization.yaml` file
pulls in data from an `.env.secret` file:

```yaml
secretGenerator:
- name: db-user-pass
  envs:
  - .env.secret
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

In all cases, you don't need to base64 encode the values. The name of the YAML
file **must** be `kustomization.yaml` or `kustomization.yml`.

### Apply the kustomization file

To create the Secret, apply the directory that contains the kustomization file:

```shell
kubectl apply -k <directory-path>
```

The output is similar to:

```
secret/database-creds-5hdh7hhgfk created
```

When a Secret is generated, the Secret name is created by hashing
the Secret data and appending the hash value to the name. This ensures that
a new Secret is generated each time the data is modified.

To verify that the Secret was created and to decode the Secret data, 

```shell
kubectl get -k <directory-path> -o jsonpath='{.data}' 
```

The output is similar to:

```
{ "password": "UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9", "username": "YWRtaW4=" }
```

```
echo 'UyFCXCpkJHpEc2I9' | base64 --decode
```

The output is similar to:

```
S!B\*d$zDsb=
```

For more information, refer to
[Managing Secrets using kubectl](/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-kubectl/#verify-the-secret) and
[Declarative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Kustomize](/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/).

## Edit a Secret {#edit-secret}

1.  In your `kustomization.yaml` file, modify the data, such as the `password`.
1.  Apply the directory that contains the kustomization file:

    ```shell
    kubectl apply -k <directory-path>
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    secret/db-user-pass-6f24b56cc8 created
    ```

The edited Secret is created as a new `Secret` object, instead of updating the
existing `Secret` object. You might need to update references to the Secret in
your Pods.

## Clean up

To delete a Secret, use `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl delete secret db-user-pass
```
