<!-- overview -->

Kubernetes provides a `certificates.k8s.io` API, which lets you provision TLS
certificates signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) that you control. These CA
and certificates can be used by your workloads to establish trust.

`certificates.k8s.io` API uses a protocol that is similar to the [ACME
draft](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/).

{{< note >}}
Certificates created using the `certificates.k8s.io` API are signed by a
[dedicated CA](#configuring-your-cluster-to-provide-signing). It is possible to configure your cluster to use the cluster root
CA for this purpose, but you should never rely on this. Do not assume that
these certificates will validate against the cluster root CA.

You need the `cfssl` tool. You can download `cfssl` from
[https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases).

Some steps in this page use the `jq` tool. If you don't have `jq`, you can
install it via your operating system's software sources, or fetch it from
[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

<!-- steps -->

## Trusting TLS in a cluster

Trusting the [custom CA](#configuring-your-cluster-to-provide-signing) from an application running as a pod usually requires
some extra application configuration. You will need to add the CA certificate
bundle to the list of CA certificates that the TLS client or server trusts. For
example, you would do this with a golang TLS config by parsing the certificate
chain and adding the parsed certificates to the `RootCAs` field in the
[`tls.Config`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#Config) struct.

{{< note >}}
Even though the custom CA certificate may be included in the filesystem (in the
ConfigMap `kube-root-ca.crt`),
you should not use that certificate authority for any purpose other than to verify internal
Kubernetes endpoints. An example of an internal Kubernetes endpoint is the
Service named `kubernetes` in the default namespace.

If you want to use a custom certificate authority for your workloads, you should generate
that CA separately, and distribute its CA certificate using a 
[ConfigMap](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap) that your pods 
have access to read.

## Requesting a certificate

The following section demonstrates how to create a TLS certificate for a
Kubernetes service accessed through DNS.

## Create a certificate signing request

Generate a private key and certificate signing request (or CSR) by running
the following command:

```shell
cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server
{
  "hosts": [
    "my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local",
    "my-pod.my-namespace.pod.cluster.local",
    "192.0.2.24",
    "10.0.34.2"
  ],
  "CN": "my-pod.my-namespace.pod.cluster.local",
  "key": {
    "algo": "ecdsa",
    "size": 256
  }
}
EOF
```

Where `192.0.2.24` is the service's cluster IP,
`my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local` is the service's DNS name,
`10.0.34.2` is the pod's IP and `my-pod.my-namespace.pod.cluster.local`
is the pod's DNS name. You should see the output similar to:

```
2022/02/01 11:45:32 [INFO] generate received request
2022/02/01 11:45:32 [INFO] received CSR
2022/02/01 11:45:32 [INFO] generating key: ecdsa-256
2022/02/01 11:45:32 [INFO] encoded CSR
```

This command generates two files; it generates `server.csr` containing the PEM
encoded [PKCS#10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2986) certification request,
and `server-key.pem` containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate that
is still to be created.

## Create a CertificateSigningRequest object to send to the Kubernetes API

Generate a CSR manifest (in YAML), and send it to the API server. You can do that by
running the following command:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: certificates.k8s.io/v1
kind: CertificateSigningRequest
metadata:
  name: my-svc.my-namespace
spec:
  request: $(cat server.csr | base64 | tr -d '\n')
  signerName: example.com/serving
  usages:
  - digital signature
  - key encipherment
  - server auth
EOF
```

Notice that the `server.csr` file created in step 1 is base64 encoded
and stashed in the `.spec.request` field. You are also requesting a
certificate with the "digital signature", "key encipherment", and "server
auth" key usages, signed by an example `example.com/serving` signer.
A specific `signerName` must be requested.
View documentation for [supported signer names](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#signers)
for more information.

The CSR should now be visible from the API in a Pending state. You can see
it by running:

```shell
kubectl describe csr my-svc.my-namespace
```

```none
Name:                   my-svc.my-namespace
Labels:                 <none>
Annotations:            <none>
CreationTimestamp:      Tue, 01 Feb 2022 11:49:15 -0500
Requesting User:        yourname@example.com
Signer:                 example.com/serving
Status:                 Pending
Subject:
        Common Name:    my-pod.my-namespace.pod.cluster.local
        Serial Number:
Subject Alternative Names:
        DNS Names:      my-pod.my-namespace.pod.cluster.local
                        my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local
        IP Addresses:   192.0.2.24
                        10.0.34.2
Events: <none>
```

## Get the CertificateSigningRequest approved {#get-the-certificate-signing-request-approved}

Approving the [certificate signing request](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/)
is either done by an automated approval process or on a one off basis by a cluster
administrator. If you're authorized to approve a certificate request, you can do that
manually using `kubectl`; for example:

```shell
kubectl certificate approve my-svc.my-namespace
```

```none
certificatesigningrequest.certificates.k8s.io/my-svc.my-namespace approved
```

You should now see the following:

```shell
kubectl get csr
```

```none
NAME                  AGE   SIGNERNAME            REQUESTOR              REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
my-svc.my-namespace   10m   example.com/serving   yourname@example.com   <none>              Approved
```

This means the certificate request has been approved and is waiting for the
requested signer to sign it.

## Sign the CertificateSigningRequest {#sign-the-certificate-signing-request}

Next, you'll play the part of a certificate signer, issue the certificate, and upload it to the API.

A signer would typically watch the CertificateSigningRequest API for objects with its `signerName`,
check that they have been approved, sign certificates for those requests,
and update the API object status with the issued certificate.

### Create a Certificate Authority

You need an authority to provide the digital signature on the new certificate.

First, create a signing certificate by running the following:

```shell
cat <<EOF | cfssl gencert -initca - | cfssljson -bare ca
{
  "CN": "My Example Signer",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  }
}
EOF
```

You should see output similar to:

```none
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] generating a new CA key and certificate from CSR
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] generate received request
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] received CSR
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] generating key: rsa-2048
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] encoded CSR
2022/02/01 11:50:39 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 263983151013686720899716354349605500797834580472
```

This produces a certificate authority key file (`ca-key.pem`) and certificate (`ca.pem`).

### Issue a certificate

{{< codenew file="tls/server-signing-config.json" >}}

Use a `server-signing-config.json` signing configuration and the certificate authority key file 
and certificate to sign the certificate request:

```shell
kubectl get csr my-svc.my-namespace -o jsonpath='{.spec.request}' | \
  base64 --decode | \
  cfssl sign -ca ca.pem -ca-key ca-key.pem -config server-signing-config.json - | \
  cfssljson -bare ca-signed-server
```

You should see the output similar to:

```
2022/02/01 11:52:26 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 576048928624926584381415936700914530534472870337
```

This produces a signed serving certificate file, `ca-signed-server.pem`.

### Upload the signed certificate

Finally, populate the signed certificate in the API object's status:

```shell
kubectl get csr my-svc.my-namespace -o json | \
  jq '.status.certificate = "'$(base64 ca-signed-server.pem | tr -d '\n')'"' | \
  kubectl replace --raw /apis/certificates.k8s.io/v1/certificatesigningrequests/my-svc.my-namespace/status -f -
```

{{< note >}}
This uses the command line tool [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to populate the base64-encoded
content in the `.status.certificate` field.
If you do not have `jq`, you can also save the JSON output to a file, populate this field manually, and
upload the resulting file.
{{< /note >}}

Once the CSR is approved and the signed certificate is uploaded, run:

```shell
kubectl get csr
```

The output is similar to:
```none
NAME                  AGE   SIGNERNAME            REQUESTOR              REQUESTEDDURATION   CONDITION
my-svc.my-namespace   20m   example.com/serving   yourname@example.com   <none>              Approved,Issued
```

## Download the certificate and use it

Now, as the requesting user, you can download the issued certificate
and save it to a `server.crt` file by running the following:

```shell
kubectl get csr my-svc.my-namespace -o jsonpath='{.status.certificate}' \
    | base64 --decode > server.crt
```

Now you can populate `server.crt` and `server-key.pem` in a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Secret" term_id="secret" >}}
that you could later mount into a Pod (for example, to use with a webserver
that serves HTTPS).

```shell
kubectl create secret tls server --cert server.crt --key server-key.pem
```

```none
secret/server created
```

Finally, you can populate `ca.pem` into a {{< glossary_tooltip text="ConfigMap" term_id="configmap" >}}
and use it as the trust root to verify the serving certificate:

```shell
kubectl create configmap example-serving-ca --from-file ca.crt=ca.pem
```

```none
configmap/example-serving-ca created
```

## Approving CertificateSigningRequests {#approving-certificate-signing-requests}

A Kubernetes administrator (with appropriate permissions) can manually approve
(or deny) CertificateSigningRequests by using the `kubectl certificate
approve` and `kubectl certificate deny` commands. However if you intend
to make heavy usage of this API, you might consider writing an automated
certificates controller.

{{< caution >}}
The ability to approve CSRs decides who trusts whom within your environment. The
ability to approve CSRs should not be granted broadly or lightly.

You should make sure that you confidently understand both the verification requirements
that fall on the approver **and** the repercussions of issuing a specific certificate
before you grant the `approve` permission.
{{< /caution >}}

Whether a machine or a human using kubectl as above, the role of the _approver_ is
to verify that the CSR satisfies two requirements:

1. The subject of the CSR controls the private key used to sign the CSR. This
   addresses the threat of a third party masquerading as an authorized subject.
   In the above example, this step would be to verify that the pod controls the
   private key used to generate the CSR.
2. The subject of the CSR is authorized to act in the requested context. This
   addresses the threat of an undesired subject joining the cluster. In the
   above example, this step would be to verify that the pod is allowed to
   participate in the requested service.

If and only if these two requirements are met, the approver should approve
the CSR and otherwise should deny the CSR.

For more information on certificate approval and access control, read
the [Certificate Signing Requests](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/)
reference page.

## Configuring your cluster to provide signing

This page assumes that a signer is set up to serve the certificates API. The
Kubernetes controller manager provides a default implementation of a signer. To
enable it, pass the `--cluster-signing-cert-file` and
`--cluster-signing-key-file` parameters to the controller manager with paths to
your Certificate Authority's keypair.
