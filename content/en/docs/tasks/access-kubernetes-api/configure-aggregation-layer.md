Configuring the [aggregation layer](/docs/concepts/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/) allows the Kubernetes apiserver to be extended with additional APIs, which are not part of the core Kubernetes APIs.

**Note:** There are a few setup requirements for getting the aggregation layer working in your environment to support mutual TLS auth between the proxy and extension apiservers. Kubernetes and the kube-apiserver have multiple CAs, so make sure that the proxy is signed by the aggregation layer CA and not by something else, like the master CA.

## Enable apiserver flags

Enable the aggregation layer via the following kube-apiserver flags. They may have already been taken care of by your provider.

    --requestheader-client-ca-file=<path to aggregator CA cert>
    --requestheader-allowed-names=aggregator
    --requestheader-extra-headers-prefix=X-Remote-Extra-
    --requestheader-group-headers=X-Remote-Group
    --requestheader-username-headers=X-Remote-User
    --proxy-client-cert-file=<path to aggregator proxy cert>
    --proxy-client-key-file=<path to aggregator proxy key>

If you are not running kube-proxy on a host running the API server, then you must make sure that the system is enabled with the following apiserver flag:

    --enable-aggregator-routing=true
