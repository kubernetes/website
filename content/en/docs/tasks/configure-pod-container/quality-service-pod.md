<!-- overview -->

This page shows how to configure Pods so that they will be assigned particular
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Quality of Service (QoS) classes" term_id="qos-class" >}}.
Kubernetes uses QoS classes to make decisions about evicting Pods when Node resources are exceeded.


When Kubernetes creates a Pod it assigns one of these QoS classes to the Pod:

* [Guaranteed](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#guaranteed)
* [Burstable](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#burstable)
* [BestEffort](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/#besteffort)

You also need to be able to create and delete namespaces.



<!-- steps -->


## Create a namespace

Create a namespace so that the resources you create in this exercise are
isolated from the rest of your cluster.

```shell
kubectl create namespace qos-example
```

## Create a Pod that gets assigned a QoS class of Guaranteed

For a Pod to be given a QoS class of `Guaranteed`:

* Every Container in the Pod must have a memory limit and a memory request.
* For every Container in the Pod, the memory limit must equal the memory request.
* Every Container in the Pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request.
* For every Container in the Pod, the CPU limit must equal the CPU request.

These restrictions apply to init containers and app containers equally.
[Ephemeral containers](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/)
cannot define resources so these restrictions do not apply.

Here is a manifest for a Pod that has one Container. The Container has a memory limit and a
memory request, both equal to 200 MiB. The Container has a CPU limit and a CPU request, both equal to 700 milliCPU:

{{< codenew file="pods/qos/qos-pod.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/qos/qos-pod.yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo --namespace=qos-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that Kubernetes gave the Pod a QoS class of `Guaranteed`. The output also
verifies that the Pod Container has a memory request that matches its memory limit, and it has
a CPU request that matches its CPU limit.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
    ...
status:
  qosClass: Guaranteed
```

{{< note >}}
If a Container specifies its own memory limit, but does not specify a memory request, Kubernetes
automatically assigns a memory request that matches the limit. Similarly, if a Container specifies its own
CPU limit, but does not specify a CPU request, Kubernetes automatically assigns a CPU request that matches
the limit.

#### Clean up {#clean-up-guaranteed}

Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod qos-demo --namespace=qos-example
```

## Create a Pod that gets assigned a QoS class of Burstable

A Pod is given a QoS class of `Burstable` if:

* The Pod does not meet the criteria for QoS class `Guaranteed`.
* At least one Container in the Pod has a memory or CPU request or limit.

Here is a manifest for a Pod that has one Container. The Container has a memory limit of 200 MiB
and a memory request of 100 MiB.

{{< codenew file="pods/qos/qos-pod-2.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/qos/qos-pod-2.yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo-2 --namespace=qos-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that Kubernetes gave the Pod a QoS class of `Burstable`:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: qos-demo-2-ctr
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        memory: 100Mi
  ...
status:
  qosClass: Burstable
```

<!-- 4th level heading to suppress entry in nav -->
#### Clean up {#clean-up-burstable}

Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod qos-demo-2 --namespace=qos-example
```

## Create a Pod that gets assigned a QoS class of BestEffort

For a Pod to be given a QoS class of `BestEffort`, the Containers in the Pod must not
have any memory or CPU limits or requests.

Here is a manifest for a Pod that has one Container. The Container has no memory or CPU
limits or requests:

{{< codenew file="pods/qos/qos-pod-3.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/qos/qos-pod-3.yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo-3 --namespace=qos-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that Kubernetes gave the Pod a QoS class of `BestEffort`:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    resources: {}
  ...
status:
  qosClass: BestEffort
```

<!-- 4th level heading to suppress entry in nav -->
#### Clean up {#clean-up-besteffort}

Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod qos-demo-3 --namespace=qos-example
```

## Create a Pod that has two Containers

Here is a manifest for a Pod that has two Containers. One container specifies a memory
request of 200 MiB. The other Container does not specify any requests or limits.

{{< codenew file="pods/qos/qos-pod-4.yaml" >}}

Notice that this Pod meets the criteria for QoS class `Burstable`. That is, it does not meet the
criteria for QoS class `Guaranteed`, and one of its Containers has a memory request.

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/qos/qos-pod-4.yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo-4 --namespace=qos-example --output=yaml
```

The output shows that Kubernetes gave the Pod a QoS class of `Burstable`:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    name: qos-demo-4-ctr-1
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: 200Mi
    ...
    name: qos-demo-4-ctr-2
    resources: {}
    ...
status:
  qosClass: Burstable
```

## Retrieve the QoS class for a Pod

Rather than see all the fields, you can view just the field you need:

```bash
kubectl --namespace=qos-example get pod qos-demo-4 -o jsonpath='{ .status.qosClass}{"\n"}'
```

```none
Burstable
```


## Clean up

Delete your namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace qos-example
```
