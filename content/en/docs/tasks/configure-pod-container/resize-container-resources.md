{{< feature-state state="alpha" for_k8s_version="v1.27" >}}

This page assumes that you are familiar with [Quality of Service](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)
for Kubernetes Pods.

This page shows how to resize CPU and memory resources assigned to containers
of a running pod without restarting the pod or its containers. A Kubernetes node
allocates resources for a pod based on its `requests`, and restricts the pod's
resource usage based on the `limits` specified in the pod's containers.

For in-place resize of pod resources:
- Container's resource `requests` and `limits` are _mutable_ for CPU
  and memory resources.
- `allocatedResources` field in `containerStatuses` of the Pod's status reflects
  the resources allocated to the pod's containers.
- `resources` field in `containerStatuses` of the Pod's status reflects the
  actual resource `requests` and `limits` that are configured on the running
  containers as reported by the container runtime.
- `resize` field in the Pod's status shows the status of the last requested
  pending resize. It can have the following values:
  - `Proposed`: This value indicates an acknowledgement of the requested resize
    and that the request was validated and recorded.
  - `InProgress`: This value indicates that the node has accepted the resize
    request and is in the process of applying it to the pod's containers.
  - `Deferred`: This value means that the requested resize cannot be granted at
    this time, and the node will keep retrying. The resize may be granted when
    other pods leave and free up node resources.
  - `Infeasible`: is a signal that the node cannot accommodate the requested
    resize. This can happen if the requested resize exceeds the maximum
    resources the node can ever allocate for a pod.

## Container Resize Policies

Resize policies allow for a more fine-grained control over how pod's containers
are resized for CPU and memory resources. For example, the container's
application may be able to handle CPU resources resized without being restarted,
but resizing memory may require that the application hence the containers be restarted.

To enable this, the Container specification allows users to specify a `resizePolicy`.
The following restart policies can be specified for resizing CPU and memory:
* `NotRequired`: Resize the container's resources while it is running.
* `RestartContainer`: Restart the container and apply new resources upon restart.

If `resizePolicy[*].restartPolicy` is not specified, it defaults to `NotRequired`.

{{< note >}}
If the Pod's `restartPolicy` is `Never`, container's resize restart policy must be
set to `NotRequired` for all Containers in the Pod.
{{< /note >}}

Below example shows a Pod whose Container's CPU can be resized without restart, but
memory resize memory requires the container to be restarted.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: qos-demo-5
  namespace: qos-example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: qos-demo-ctr-5
    image: nginx
    resizePolicy:
    - resourceName: cpu
      restartPolicy: NotRequired
    - resourceName: memory
      restartPolicy: RestartContainer
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "700m"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "700m"
```

{{< note >}}
In the above example, if desired requests or limits for both CPU _and_ memory
have changed, the container will be restarted in order to resize its memory.

<!-- steps -->


## Create a pod with resource requests and limits

You can create a Guaranteed or Burstable [Quality of Service](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/)
class pod by specifying requests and/or limits for a pod's containers.

Consider the following manifest for a Pod that has one Container.

{{< codenew file="pods/qos/qos-pod-5.yaml" >}}

Create the pod in the `qos-example` namespace:

```shell
kubectl create namespace qos-example
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/qos/qos-pod-5.yaml
```

This pod is classified as a Guaranteed QoS class requesting 700m CPU and 200Mi
memory.

View detailed information about the pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo-5 --output=yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

Also notice that the values of `resizePolicy[*].restartPolicy` defaulted to
`NotRequired`, indicating that CPU and memory can be resized while container
is running.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    resizePolicy:
    - resourceName: cpu
      restartPolicy: NotRequired
    - resourceName: memory
      restartPolicy: NotRequired
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
...
  containerStatuses:
...
    name: qos-demo-ctr-5
    ready: true
...
    allocatedResources:
      cpu: 700m
      memory: 200Mi
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 700m
        memory: 200Mi
    restartCount: 0
    started: true
...
  qosClass: Guaranteed
```


## Updating the pod's resources

Let's say the CPU requirements have increased, and 0.8 CPU is now desired. This
is typically determined, and may be programmatically applied, by an entity such as
[VerticalPodAutoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler#readme) (VPA).

{{< note >}}
While you can change a Pod's requests and limits to express new desired
resources, you cannot change the QoS class in which the Pod was created.
{{< /note >}}

Now, patch the Pod's Container with CPU requests & limits both set to `800m`:

```shell
kubectl -n qos-example patch pod qos-demo-5 --patch '{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"qos-demo-ctr-5", "resources":{"requests":{"cpu":"800m"}, "limits":{"cpu":"800m"}}}]}}'
```

Query the Pod's detailed information after the Pod has been patched.

```shell
kubectl get pod qos-demo-5 --output=yaml --namespace=qos-example
```

The Pod's spec below reflects the updated CPU requests and limits.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 800m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 800m
        memory: 200Mi
...
  containerStatuses:
...
    allocatedResources:
      cpu: 800m
      memory: 200Mi
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 800m
        memory: 200Mi
      requests:
        cpu: 800m
        memory: 200Mi
    restartCount: 0
    started: true
```

Observe that the `allocatedResources` values have been updated to reflect the new
desired CPU requests. This indicates that node was able to accommodate the
increased CPU resource needs.

In the Container's status, updated CPU resource values shows that new CPU
resources have been applied. The Container's `restartCount` remains unchanged,
indicating that container's CPU resources were resized without restarting the container.


## Clean up

Delete your namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace qos-example
```
