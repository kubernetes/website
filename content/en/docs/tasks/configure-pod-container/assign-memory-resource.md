{{% capture overview %}}

This page shows how to assign a memory *request* and a memory *limit* to a
Container. A Container is guaranteed to have as much memory as it requests,
but is not allowed to use more memory than its limit.

Each node in your cluster must have at least 300 MiB of memory.

A few of the steps on this page require that the
[Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) service is running
in your cluster. But if you don't have Heapster running, you can do most
of the steps, and it won't be a problem if you skip the Heapster steps.

If you are running minikube, run the following command to enable heapster:

```shell
minikube addons enable heapster
```

To see whether the Heapster service is running, enter this command:

```shell
kubectl get services --namespace=kube-system
```

If the Heapster service is running, it shows in the output:

```shell
NAMESPACE    NAME      CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)  AGE
kube-system  heapster  10.11.240.9   <none>       80/TCP   6d
```

## Create a namespace

Create a namespace so that the resources you create in this exercise are
isolated from the rest of your cluster.

```shell
kubectl create namespace mem-example
```

## Specify a memory request and a memory limit

To specify a memory request for a Container, include the `resources:requests` field
in the Container's resource manifest. To specify a memory limit, include `resources:limits`.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that has one Container. The Container has a memory
request of 100 MiB and a memory limit of 200 MiB. Here's the configuration file
for the Pod:

{{< code file="memory-request-limit.yaml" >}}

In the configuration file, the `args` section provides arguments for the Container when it starts.
The `"--vm-bytes", "150M"` arguments tell the Container to attempt to allocate 150 MiB of memory.

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/memory-request-limit.yaml --namespace=mem-example
```

Verify that the Pod's Container is running:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo --namespace=mem-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo --output=yaml --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the one Container in the Pod has a memory request of 100 MiB
and a memory limit of 200 MiB.


```yaml
...
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 200Mi
  requests:
    memory: 100Mi
...
```

Start a proxy so that you can call the Heapster service:

```shell
kubectl proxy
```

In another command window, get the memory usage from the Heapster service:

```
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy/api/v1/model/namespaces/mem-example/pods/memory-demo/metrics/memory/usage
```

The output shows that the Pod is using about 162,900,000 bytes of memory, which
is about 150 MiB. This is greater than the Pod's 100 MiB request, but within the
Pod's 200 MiB limit.

```json
{
 "timestamp": "2017-06-20T18:54:00Z",
 "value": 162856960
}
```


Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod memory-demo --namespace=mem-example
```


## Exceed a Container's memory limit

A Container can exceed its memory request if the Node has memory available. But a Container
is not allowed to use more than its memory limit. If a Container allocates more memory than
its limit, the Container becomes a candidate for termination. If the Container continues to
consume memory beyond its limit, the Container is terminated. If a terminated Container is
restartable, the kubelet will restart it, as with any other type of runtime failure.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that attempts to allocate more memory than its limit.
Here is the configuration file for a Pod that has one Container. The Container has a
memory request of 50 MiB and a memory limit of 100 MiB.

{{< code file="memory-request-limit-2.yaml" >}}

In the configuration file, in the `args` section, you can see that the Container
will attempt to allocate 250 MiB of memory, which is well above the 100 MiB limit.

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/memory-request-limit-2.yaml --namespace=mem-example
```

View detailed information about the Pod:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
```

At this point, the Container might be running, or it might have been killed. If the
Container has not yet been killed, repeat the preceding command until you see that
the Container has been killed:

```shell
NAME            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
memory-demo-2   0/1       OOMKilled   1          24s
```

Get a more detailed view of the Container's status:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo-2 --output=yaml --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the Container has been killed because it is out of memory (OOM).

```shell
lastState:
   terminated:
     containerID: docker://65183c1877aaec2e8427bc95609cc52677a454b56fcb24340dbd22917c23b10f
     exitCode: 137
     finishedAt: 2017-06-20T20:52:19Z
     reason: OOMKilled
     startedAt: null
```

The Container in this exercise is restartable, so the kubelet will restart it. Enter
this command several times to see that the Container gets repeatedly killed and restarted:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the Container gets killed, restarted, killed again, restarted again, and so on:

```
stevepe@sperry-1:~/steveperry-53.github.io$ kubectl get pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
NAME            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
memory-demo-2   0/1       OOMKilled   1          37s
stevepe@sperry-1:~/steveperry-53.github.io$ kubectl get pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memory-demo-2   1/1       Running   2          40s
```

View detailed information about the Pod's history:


```
kubectl describe pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the Container starts and fails repeatedly:


```
... Normal  Created   Created container with id 66a3a20aa7980e61be4922780bf9d24d1a1d8b7395c09861225b0eba1b1f8511
... Warning BackOff   Back-off restarting failed container
```

View detailed information about your cluster's Nodes:


```
kubectl describe nodes
```

The output includes a record of the Container being killed because of an out-of-memory condition:

```
Warning OOMKilling  Memory cgroup out of memory: Kill process 4481 (stress) score 1994 or sacrifice child
```

Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod memory-demo-2 --namespace=mem-example
```

## Specify a memory request that is too big for your Nodes

Memory requests and limits are associated with Containers, but it is useful to think
of a Pod as having a memory request and limit. The memory request for the Pod is the
sum of the memory requests for all the Containers in the Pod. Likewise, the memory
limit for the Pod is the sum of the limits of all the Containers in the Pod.

Pod scheduling is based on requests. A Pod is scheduled to run on a Node only if the Node
has enough available memory to satisfy the Pod's memory request.

In this exercise, you create a Pod that has a memory request so big that it exceeds the
capacity of any Node in your cluster. Here is the configuration file for a Pod that has one
Container. The Container requests 1000 GiB of memory, which is likely to exceed the capacity
of any Node in your cluster.

{{< code file="memory-request-limit-3.yaml" >}}

Create the Pod:

```shell
kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/memory-request-limit-3.yaml --namespace=mem-example
```

View the Pod's status:

```shell
kubectl get pod memory-demo-3 --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the Pod's status is PENDING. That is, the Pod has not been
scheduled to run on any Node, and it will remain in the PENDING state indefinitely:


```
kubectl get pod memory-demo-3 --namespace=mem-example
NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
memory-demo-3   0/1       Pending   0          25s
```

View detailed information about the Pod, including events:


```shell
kubectl describe pod memory-demo-3 --namespace=mem-example
```

The output shows that the Container cannot be scheduled because of insufficient memory on the Nodes:


```shell
Events:
  ...  Reason            Message
       ------            -------
  ...  FailedScheduling  No nodes are available that match all of the following predicates:: Insufficient memory (3).
```

## Memory units

The memory resource is measured in bytes. You can express memory as a plain integer or a
fixed-point integer with one of these suffixes: E, P, T, G, M, K, Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki.
For example, the following represent approximately the same value:

```shell
128974848, 129e6, 129M , 123Mi
```

Delete your Pod:

```shell
kubectl delete pod memory-demo-3 --namespace=mem-example
```

## If you don’t specify a memory limit

If you don’t specify a memory limit for a Container, then one of these situations applies:

* The Container has no upper bound on the amount of memory it uses. The Container
could use all of the memory available on the Node where it is running.

* The Container is running in a namespace that has a default memory limit, and the
Container is automatically assigned the default limit. Cluster administrators can use a
[LimitRange](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#limitrange-v1-core)
to specify a default value for the memory limit.

## Motivation for memory requests and limits

By configuring memory requests and limits for the Containers that run in your
cluster, you can make efficient use of the memory resources available on your cluster's
Nodes. By keeping a Pod's memory request low, you give the Pod a good chance of being
scheduled. By having a memory limit that is greater than the memory request, you accomplish two things:

* The Pod can have bursts of activity where it makes use of memory that happens to be available.
* The amount of memory a Pod can use during a burst is limited to some reasonable amount.

## Clean up

Delete your namespace. This deletes all the Pods that you created for this task:

```shell
kubectl delete namespace mem-example
```
