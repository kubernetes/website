## kubectl

The Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, allows you to run commands against
Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage
cluster resources, and view logs.

See [Install and Set Up kubectl](/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for information about how to
download and install `kubectl` and set it up for accessing your cluster.

You can also read the [`kubectl` reference documentation](/docs/reference/kubectl/).

## Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/) is a tool that lets you run
Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal
computer (including Windows, macOS and Linux PCs) so that you can try out Kubernetes,
or for daily development work.

You can follow the official [Get Started!](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
guide, or read [Install Minikube](/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) if your focus
is on getting the tool installed.

Once you have Minikube working, you can use it to
[run a sample application](/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/).

## kind

Like Minikube, [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) lets you run Kubernetes on
your local computer. Unlike Minikube, kind only works with a single container runtime:
it requires that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
and configured.

[Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) shows you what you
need to do to get up and running with kind.
