<!-- overview -->

An [Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is an API object that defines rules which allow external access
to services in a cluster. An [Ingress controller](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) fulfills the rules set in the Ingress.

This page shows you how to set up a simple Ingress which routes requests to Service web or web2 depending on the HTTP URI.

If you are using an older Kubernetes version, switch to the documentation
for that version.


### Create a Minikube cluster

Using Katacoda
: {{< kat-button >}}

Locally
: If you already [installed Minikube](/docs/tasks/tools/#minikube)
  locally, run `minikube start` to create a cluster.

<!-- steps -->

## Enable the Ingress controller

1. To enable the NGINX Ingress controller, run the following command:

    ```shell
    minikube addons enable ingress
    ```

1. Verify that the NGINX Ingress controller is running


   {{< tabs name="tab_with_md" >}}
   {{% tab name="minikube v1.19 or later" %}}
```shell
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```
   {{< note >}}It can take up to a minute before you see these pods running OK.{{< /note >}}

   The output is similar to:

```
NAME                                        READY   STATUS      RESTARTS    AGE
ingress-nginx-admission-create-g9g49        0/1     Completed   0          11m
ingress-nginx-admission-patch-rqp78         0/1     Completed   1          11m
ingress-nginx-controller-59b45fb494-26npt   1/1     Running     0          11m
```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab name="minikube v1.18.1 or earlier" %}}
```shell
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
   {{< note >}}It can take up to a minute before you see these pods running OK.{{< /note >}}

   The output is similar to:

```
NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-http-backend-59868b7dd6-xb8tq       1/1       Running   0          1m
kube-addon-manager-minikube                 1/1       Running   0          3m
kube-dns-6dcb57bcc8-n4xd4                   3/3       Running   0          2m
kubernetes-dashboard-5498ccf677-b8p5h       1/1       Running   0          2m
nginx-ingress-controller-5984b97644-rnkrg   1/1       Running   0          1m
storage-provisioner                         1/1       Running   0          2m
```

  Make sure that you see a Pod with a name that starts with `nginx-ingress-controller-`.

## Deploy a hello, world app

1. Create a Deployment using the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl create deployment web --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
   ```

   The output should be:

   ```
   deployment.apps/web created
   ```

1. Expose the Deployment:

   ```shell
   kubectl expose deployment web --type=NodePort --port=8080
   ```

   The output should be:

   ```
   service/web exposed
   ```

1. Verify the Service is created and is available on a node port:

    ```shell
   kubectl get service web
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   NAME      TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   web       NodePort   10.104.133.249   <none>        8080:31637/TCP   12m
   ```

1. Visit the Service via NodePort:

   ```shell
   minikube service web --url
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   http://172.17.0.15:31637
   ```

   {{< note >}}Katacoda environment only: at the top of the terminal panel, click the plus sign, and then click **Select port to view on Host 1**. Enter the NodePort, in this case `31637`, and then click **Display Port**.{{< /note >}}

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   Hello, world!
   Version: 1.0.0
   Hostname: web-55b8c6998d-8k564
   ```

   You can now access the sample app via the Minikube IP address and NodePort. The next step lets you access
   the app using the Ingress resource.

## Create an Ingress

The following manifest defines an Ingress that sends traffic to your Service via hello-world.info.

1. Create `example-ingress.yaml` from the following file:

   {{< codenew file="service/networking/example-ingress.yaml" >}}

1. Create the Ingress object by running the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/networking/example-ingress.yaml
   ```

   The output should be:

   ```
   ingress.networking.k8s.io/example-ingress created
   ```

1. Verify the IP address is set:

   ```shell
   kubectl get ingress
   ```

   {{< note >}}This can take a couple of minutes.{{< /note >}}

   You should see an IPv4 address in the ADDRESS column; for example:

   ```
   NAME              CLASS    HOSTS              ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
   example-ingress   <none>   hello-world.info   172.17.0.15    80      38s
   ```

1. Add the following line to the bottom of the `/etc/hosts` file on
   your computer (you will need administrator access):

    ```
    172.17.0.15 hello-world.info
    ```

   {{< note >}}If you are running Minikube locally, use `minikube ip` to get the external IP. The IP address displayed within the ingress list will be the internal IP.{{< /note >}}

    After you make this change, your web browser sends requests for
    hello-world.info URLs to Minikube.

1. Verify that the Ingress controller is directing traffic:

    ```shell
    curl hello-world.info
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    Hello, world!
    Version: 1.0.0
    Hostname: web-55b8c6998d-8k564
    ```

    {{< note >}}If you are running Minikube locally, you can visit hello-world.info from your browser.{{< /note >}}

## Create a second Deployment

1. Create another Deployment using the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl create deployment web2 --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0
   ```
   The output should be:

   ```
   deployment.apps/web2 created
   ```

1. Expose the second Deployment:

   ```shell
   kubectl expose deployment web2 --port=8080 --type=NodePort
   ```

   The output should be:

   ```
   service/web2 exposed
   ```

## Edit the existing Ingress {#edit-ingress}

1. Edit the existing `example-ingress.yaml` manifest, and add the
   following lines at the end:

    ```yaml
              - path: /v2
                pathType: Prefix
                backend:
                  service:
                    name: web2
                    port:
                      number: 8080
    ```

1. Apply the changes:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f example-ingress.yaml
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   ingress.networking/example-ingress configured
   ```

## Test your Ingress

1. Access the 1st version of the Hello World app.

   ```shell
   curl hello-world.info
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   Hello, world!
   Version: 1.0.0
   Hostname: web-55b8c6998d-8k564
   ```

1. Access the 2nd version of the Hello World app.

   ```shell
   curl hello-world.info/v2
   ```

   The output is similar to:

   ```
   Hello, world!
   Version: 2.0.0
   Hostname: web2-75cd47646f-t8cjk
   ```

   {{< note >}}If you are running Minikube locally, you can visit hello-world.info and hello-world.info/v2 from your browser.{{< /note >}}
