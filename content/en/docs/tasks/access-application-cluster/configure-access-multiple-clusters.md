<!-- overview -->

This page shows how to configure access to multiple clusters by using
configuration files. After your clusters, users, and contexts are defined in
one or more configuration files, you can quickly switch between clusters by using the
`kubectl config use-context` command.

{{< note >}}
A file that is used to configure access to a cluster is sometimes called
a *kubeconfig file*. This is a generic way of referring to configuration files.
It does not mean that there is a file named `kubeconfig`.
{{< /note >}}


{{< warning >}}
Only use kubeconfig files from trusted sources. Using a specially-crafted kubeconfig
file could result in malicious code execution or file exposure.
If you must use an untrusted kubeconfig file, inspect it carefully first, much as you would a shell script.
{{< /warning>}}

To check that {{< glossary_tooltip text="kubectl" term_id="kubectl" >}} is installed,
run `kubectl version --client`. The kubectl version should be
[within one minor version](/releases/version-skew-policy/#kubectl) of your
cluster's API server.

## Define clusters, users, and contexts

Suppose you have two clusters, one for development work and one for test work.
In the `development` cluster, your frontend developers work in a namespace called `frontend`,
and your storage developers work in a namespace called `storage`. In your `test` cluster,
developers work in the default namespace, or they create auxiliary namespaces as they
see fit. Access to the development cluster requires authentication by certificate. Access
to the test cluster requires authentication by username and password.

Create a directory named `config-exercise`. In your
`config-exercise` directory, create a file named `config-demo` with this content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
preferences: {}

clusters:
- cluster:
  name: development
- cluster:
  name: test

users:
- name: developer
- name: experimenter

contexts:
- context:
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
  name: dev-storage
- context:
  name: exp-test
```

A configuration file describes clusters, users, and contexts. Your `config-demo` file
has the framework to describe two clusters, two users, and three contexts.

Go to your `config-exercise` directory. Enter these commands to add cluster details to
your configuration file:

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster development --server=https://1.2.3.4 --certificate-authority=fake-ca-file
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-cluster test --server=https://5.6.7.8 --insecure-skip-tls-verify
```

Add user details to your configuration file:

{{< caution >}}
Storing passwords in Kubernetes client config is risky. A better alternative would be to use a credential plugin and store them separately. See: [client-go credential plugins](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins)
{{< /caution >}}

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials developer --client-certificate=fake-cert-file --client-key=fake-key-seefile
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-credentials experimenter --username=exp --password=some-password
```

{{< note >}}
- To delete a user you can run `kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset users.<name>`
- To remove a cluster, you can run `kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset clusters.<name>`
- To remove a context, you can run `kubectl --kubeconfig=config-demo config unset contexts.<name>`
{{< /note >}}

Add context details to your configuration file:

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-frontend --cluster=development --namespace=frontend --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context dev-storage --cluster=development --namespace=storage --user=developer
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo set-context exp-test --cluster=test --namespace=default --user=experimenter
```

Open your `config-demo` file to see the added details. As an alternative to opening the
`config-demo` file, you can use the `config view` command.

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo view
```

The output shows the two clusters, two users, and three contexts:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: fake-ca-file
    server: https://1.2.3.4
  name: development
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: https://5.6.7.8
  name: test
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: frontend
    user: developer
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: storage
    user: developer
  name: dev-storage
- context:
    cluster: test
    namespace: default
    user: experimenter
  name: exp-test
current-context: ""
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: developer
  user:
    client-certificate: fake-cert-file
    client-key: fake-key-file
- name: experimenter
  user:
    # Documentation note (this comment is NOT part of the command output).
    # Storing passwords in Kubernetes client config is risky.
    # A better alternative would be to use a credential plugin
    # and store the credentials separately.
    # See https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#client-go-credential-plugins
    password: some-password
    username: exp
```

The `fake-ca-file`, `fake-cert-file` and `fake-key-file` above are the placeholders
for the pathnames of the certificate files. You need to change these to the actual pathnames
of certificate files in your environment.

Sometimes you may want to use Base64-encoded data embedded here instead of separate
certificate files; in that case you need to add the suffix `-data` to the keys, for example,
`certificate-authority-data`, `client-certificate-data`, `client-key-data`.

Each context is a triple (cluster, user, namespace). For example, the
`dev-frontend` context says, "Use the credentials of the `developer`
user to access the `frontend` namespace of the `development` cluster".

Set the current context:

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo use-context dev-frontend
```

Now whenever you enter a `kubectl` command, the action will apply to the cluster,
and namespace listed in the `dev-frontend` context. And the command will use
the credentials of the user listed in the `dev-frontend` context.

To see only the configuration information associated with
the current context, use the `--minify` flag.

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo view --minify
```

The output shows configuration information associated with the `dev-frontend` context:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: fake-ca-file
    server: https://1.2.3.4
  name: development
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: frontend
    user: developer
  name: dev-frontend
current-context: dev-frontend
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: developer
  user:
    client-certificate: fake-cert-file
    client-key: fake-key-file
```

Now suppose you want to work for a while in the test cluster.

Change the current context to `exp-test`:

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo use-context exp-test
```

Now any `kubectl` command you give will apply to the default namespace of
the `test` cluster. And the command will use the credentials of the user
listed in the `exp-test` context.

View configuration associated with the new current context, `exp-test`.

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo view --minify
```

Finally, suppose you want to work for a while in the `storage` namespace of the
`development` cluster.

Change the current context to `dev-storage`:

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo use-context dev-storage
```

View configuration associated with the new current context, `dev-storage`.

```shell
kubectl config --kubeconfig=config-demo view --minify
```

## Create a second configuration file

In your `config-exercise` directory, create a file named `config-demo-2` with this content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
preferences: {}

contexts:
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: ramp
    user: developer
  name: dev-ramp-up
```

The preceding configuration file defines a new context named `dev-ramp-up`.

## Set the KUBECONFIG environment variable

See whether you have an environment variable named `KUBECONFIG`. If so, save the
current value of your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, so you can restore it later.
For example:

### Linux

```shell
export KUBECONFIG_SAVED="$KUBECONFIG"
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$Env:KUBECONFIG_SAVED=$ENV:KUBECONFIG
```

 The `KUBECONFIG` environment variable is a list of paths to configuration files. The list is
colon-delimited for Linux and Mac, and semicolon-delimited for Windows. If you have
a `KUBECONFIG` environment variable, familiarize yourself with the configuration files
in the list.

Temporarily append two paths to your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. For example:

### Linux

```shell
export KUBECONFIG="${KUBECONFIG}:config-demo:config-demo-2"
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$Env:KUBECONFIG=("config-demo;config-demo-2")
```

In your `config-exercise` directory, enter this command:

```shell
kubectl config view
```

The output shows merged information from all the files listed in your `KUBECONFIG`
environment variable. In particular, notice that the merged information has the
`dev-ramp-up` context from the `config-demo-2` file and the three contexts from
the `config-demo` file:

```yaml
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: frontend
    user: developer
  name: dev-frontend
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: ramp
    user: developer
  name: dev-ramp-up
- context:
    cluster: development
    namespace: storage
    user: developer
  name: dev-storage
- context:
    cluster: test
    namespace: default
    user: experimenter
  name: exp-test
```

For more information about how kubeconfig files are merged, see
[Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files](/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/)

## Explore the $HOME/.kube directory

If you already have a cluster, and you can use `kubectl` to interact with
the cluster, then you probably have a file named `config` in the `$HOME/.kube`
directory.

Go to `$HOME/.kube`, and see what files are there. Typically, there is a file named
`config`. There might also be other configuration files in this directory. Briefly
familiarize yourself with the contents of these files.

## Append $HOME/.kube/config to your KUBECONFIG environment variable

If you have a `$HOME/.kube/config` file, and it's not already listed in your
`KUBECONFIG` environment variable, append it to your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable now.
For example:

### Linux

```shell
export KUBECONFIG="${KUBECONFIG}:${HOME}/.kube/config"
```

### Windows Powershell

```powershell
$Env:KUBECONFIG="$Env:KUBECONFIG;$HOME\.kube\config"
```

View configuration information merged from all the files that are now listed
in your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable. In your config-exercise directory, enter:

```shell
kubectl config view
```

## Clean up

Return your `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to its original value. For example:<br>

### Linux

```shell
export KUBECONFIG="$KUBECONFIG_SAVED"
```

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$Env:KUBECONFIG=$ENV:KUBECONFIG_SAVED
```

## Check the subject represented by the kubeconfig

It is not always obvious what attributes (username, groups) you will get after authenticating to the cluster. 
It can be even more challenging if you are managing more than one cluster at the same time.

There is a `kubectl` subcommand to check subject attributes, such as username, for your selected Kubernetes 
client context: `kubectl auth whoami`.

Read [API access to authentication information for a client](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#self-subject-review)
to learn about this in more detail.
