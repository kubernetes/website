{{% capture overview %}}

[Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) is a standalone tool
to customize Kubernetes objects
through a [kustomization file](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/kustomization.yaml).

Since 1.14, Kubectl also
supports the management of Kubernetes objects using a kustomization file.
To view Resources found in a directory containing a kustomization file, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl kustomize <kustomization_directory>
```

To apply those Resources, run `kubectl apply` with `--kustomize` or `-k` flag:

```shell
kubectl apply -k <kustomization_directory>
```

## Overview of Kustomize

Kustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes configurations. It has the following features to manage application configuration files:

* generating resources from other sources
* setting cross-cutting fields for resources
* composing and customizing collections of resources

### Generating Resources

ConfigMap and Secret hold config or sensitive data that are used by other Kubernetes objects, such as Pods. The source
of truth of ConfigMap or Secret are usually from somewhere else, such as a `.properties` file or a ssh key file.
Kustomize has `secretGenerator` and `configMapGenerator`, which generate Secret and ConfigMap from files or literals.

#### configMapGenerator

To generate a ConfigMap from a file, add an entry to `files` list in `configMapGenerator`. Here is an example of generating a ConfigMap with a data item from a file content.

```shell
# Create a application.properties file
cat <<EOF >application.properties
FOO=Bar
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
configMapGenerator:
- name: example-configmap-1
  files:
  - application.properties
EOF
```

The generated ConfigMap can be checked by the following command:

```shell
kubectl kustomize ./
```

The generated ConfigMap is:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  application.properties: |
    FOO=Bar
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-1-8mbdf7882g
```

ConfigMap can also be generated from literal key-value pairs. To generate a ConfigMap from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to `literals` list in configMapGenerator. Here is an example of generating a ConfigMap with a data item from a key-value pair.

```shell
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
configMapGenerator:
- name: example-configmap-2
  literals:
  - FOO=Bar
EOF
```

The generated ConfigMap can be checked by the following command:

```shell
kubectl kustomize ./
```

The generated ConfigMap is

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  FOO: Bar
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: example-configmap-2-g2hdhfc6tk
```

#### secretGenerator

You can generate Secrets from files or literal key-value pairs. To generate a Secret from a file, add an entry to `files` list in `secretGenerator`. Here is an example of generating a Secret with a data item from a file.

```shell
# Create a password.txt file
cat <<EOF >./password.txt
username=admin
password=secret
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
secretGenerator:
- name: example-secret-1
  files:
  - password.txt
EOF
```

The generated Secret is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password.txt: dXNlcm5hbWU9YWRtaW4KcGFzc3dvcmQ9c2VjcmV0Cg==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-secret-1-t2kt65hgtb
type: Opaque
```

To generate a Secret from a literal key-value pair, add an entry to `literals` list in `secretGenerator`. Here is an example of generating a Secret with a data item from a key-value pair.

```shell
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
secretGenerator:
- name: example-secret-2
  literals:
  - username=admin
  - password=secert 
EOF
```

The generated Secret is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: c2VjZXJ0
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-secret-2-t52t6g96d8
type: Opaque
```

#### generatorOptions

The generated ConfigMaps and Secrets have a suffix appended by hashing the contents. This ensures that a new ConfigMap or Secret is generated when the content is changed. To disable the behavior of appending a suffix, one can use `generatorOptions`. Besides that, it is also possible to specify cross-cutting options for generated ConfigMaps and Secrets.

```shell
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
configMapGenerator:
- name: example-configmap-3
  literals:
  - FOO=Bar
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true
  labels:
    type: generated
  annotations:
    note: generated
EOF
```

Run`kubectl kustomize ./` to view the generated ConfigMap:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  FOO: Bar
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    note: generated
  labels:
    type: generated
  name: example-configmap-3
```

### Setting cross-cutting fields

It is quite common to set cross-cutting fields for all Kubernetes resources in a project. 
Some use cases for setting cross-cutting fields:

* setting the same namespace for all Resource
* adding the same name prefix or suffix
* adding the same set of labels
* adding the same set of annotations

Here is an example:

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml
cat <<EOF >./deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
namespace: my-namespace
namePrefix: dev-
nameSuffix: "-001"
commonLabels:
  app: bingo
commonAnnotations:
  oncallPager: 800-555-1212
resources:
- deployment.yaml
EOF
```

Run `kubectl kustomize ./` to view those fields are all set in the Deployment Resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    oncallPager: 800-555-1212
  labels:
    app: bingo
  name: dev-nginx-deployment-001
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bingo
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        oncallPager: 800-555-1212
      labels:
        app: bingo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
```

### Composing and Customizing Resources

It is common to compose a set of Resources in a project and manage them inside
the same file or directory. 
Kustomize offers composing Resources from different files and applying patches or other customization to them. 

#### Composing

Kustomize supports composition of different resources. The `resources` field, in the `kustomization.yaml` file, defines the list of resources to include in a configuration. Set the path to a resource's configuration file in the `resources` list.
Here is an example for an nginx application with a Deployment and a Service.

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml file
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create a service.yaml file
cat <<EOF > service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    run: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
EOF

# Create a kustomization.yaml composing them
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml
EOF
```

The Resources from `kubectl kustomize ./` contains both the Deployment and the Service objects.

#### Customizing

On top of Resources, one can apply different customizations by applying patches. Kustomize supports different patching
mechanisms through `patchesStrategicMerge` and `patchesJson6902`. `patchesStrategicMerge` is a list of file paths. Each file should be resolved to a [strategic merge patch](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-api-machinery/strategic-merge-patch.md). The names inside the patches must match Resource names that are already loaded. Small patches that do one thing are recommended. For example, create one patch for increasing the deployment replica number and another patch for setting the memory limit.

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml file
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create a patch increase_replicas.yaml
cat <<EOF > increase_replicas.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
EOF

# Create another patch set_memory.yaml
cat <<EOF > set_memory.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512Mi
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
patchesStrategicMerge:
- increase_replicas.yaml
- set_memory.yaml
EOF
```

Run `kubectl kustomize ./` to view the Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        limits:
          memory: 512Mi
        name: my-nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Not all Resources or fields support strategic merge patches. To support modifying arbitrary fields in arbitrary Resources,
Kustomize offers applying [JSON patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) through `patchesJson6902`.
To find the correct Resource for a Json patch, the group, version, kind and name of that Resource need to be
specified in `kustomization.yaml`. For example, increasing the replica number of a Deployment object can also be done
through `patchesJson6902`.

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml file
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create a json patch
cat <<EOF > patch.yaml
- op: replace
  path: /spec/replicas
  value: 3 
EOF

# Create a kustomization.yaml
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml

patchesJson6902:
- target:
    group: apps
    version: v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-nginx
  path: patch.yaml  
EOF
```

Run `kubectl kustomize ./` to see the `replicas` field is updated:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: my-nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

In addition to patches, Kustomize also offers customizing container images or injecting field values from other objects into containers
without creating patches. For example, you can change the image used inside containers by specifying the new image in `images` field in `kustomization.yaml`.

```shell
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
images:
- name: nginx
  newName: my.image.registry/nginx
  newTag: 1.4.0
EOF
```
Run `kubectl kustomize ./` to see that the image being used is updated:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: my.image.registry/nginx:1.4.0
        name: my-nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Sometimes, the application running in a Pod may need to use configuration values from other objects. For example,
a Pod from a Deployment object need to read the corresponding Service name from Env or as a command argument.
Since the Service name may change as `namePrefix` or `nameSuffix` is added in the `kustomization.yaml` file. It is
not recommended to hard code the Service name in the command argument. For this usage, Kustomize can inject the Service name into containers through `vars`.

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml file
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        command: ["start", "--host", "\$(MY_SERVICE_NAME)"]
EOF

# Create a service.yaml file
cat <<EOF > service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    run: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
EOF

cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
namePrefix: dev-
nameSuffix: "-001"

resources:
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml

vars:
- name: MY_SERVICE_NAME
  objref:
    kind: Service
    name: my-nginx
    apiVersion: v1
EOF
```

Run `kubectl kustomize ./` to see that the Service name injected into containers is `dev-my-nginx-001`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dev-my-nginx-001
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - start
        - --host
        - dev-my-nginx-001
        image: nginx
        name: my-nginx
```

## Bases and Overlays

Kustomize has the concepts of **bases** and **overlays**. A **base** is a directory with a `kustomization.yaml`, which contains a
set of resources and associated customization. A base could be either a local directory or a directory from a remote repo,
as long as a `kustomization.yaml` is present inside. An **overlay** is a directory with a `kustomization.yaml` that refers to other
kustomization directories as its `bases`. A **base** has no knowledge of an overlay and can be used in multiple overlays.
An overlay may have multiple bases and it composes all resources
from bases and may also have customization on top of them.

Here is an example of a base:

```shell
# Create a directory to hold the base
mkdir base
# Create a base/deployment.yaml
cat <<EOF > base/deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
EOF

# Create a base/service.yaml file
cat <<EOF > base/service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
  labels:
    run: my-nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    run: my-nginx
EOF
# Create a base/kustomization.yaml
cat <<EOF > base/kustomization.yaml
resources:
- deployment.yaml
- service.yaml
```

This base can be used in multiple overlays. You can add different `namePrefix` or other cross-cutting fields
in different overlays. Here are two overlays using the same base.

```shell
mkdir dev
cat <<EOF > dev/kustomization.yaml
bases:
- ../base
namePrefix: dev-
EOF

mkdir prod
cat <<EOF > prod/kustomization.yaml
bases:
- ../base
namePrefix: prod-
EOF
```

## How to apply/view/delete objects using Kustomize

Use `--kustomize` or `-k` in `kubectl` commands to recognize Resources managed by `kustomization.yaml`. 
Note that `-k` should point to a kustomization directory, such as

```shell
kubectl apply -k <kustomization directory>/
```

Given the following `kustomization.yaml`,

```shell
# Create a deployment.yaml file
cat <<EOF > deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: my-nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF

# Create a kustomization.yaml
cat <<EOF >./kustomization.yaml
namePrefix: dev-
commonLabels:
  app: my-nginx
resources:
- deployment.yaml
EOF
```

Run the following command to apply the Deployment object `dev-my-nginx`:

```shell
> kubectl apply -k ./
deployment.apps/dev-my-nginx created
```

Run one of the following commands to view the Deployment object `dev-my-nginx`:

```shell
kubectl get -k ./
```

```shell
kubectl describe -k ./
```

Run the following command to delete the Deployment object `dev-my-nginx`:

```shell
> kubectl delete -k ./
deployment.apps "dev-my-nginx" deleted
```
