This document describes _persistent volumes_ in Kubernetes. Familiarity with
[volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) is suggested.

## Introduction

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute instances.
The PersistentVolume subsystem provides an API for users and administrators
that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.
To do this, we introduce two new API resources: PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim.

A _PersistentVolume_ (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been
provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using
[Storage Classes](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/). It is a resource in
the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs are volume plugins like
Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual Pod that uses the PV.
This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that
NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A _PersistentVolumeClaim_ (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar
to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can
request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific
size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany or
ReadWriteMany, see [AccessModes](#access-modes)).

While PersistentVolumeClaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources,
it is common that users need PersistentVolumes with varying properties, such as
performance, for different problems. Cluster administrators need to be able to
offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than size and access
modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented.
For these needs, there is the _StorageClass_ resource.

See the [detailed walkthrough with working examples](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/).

## Lifecycle of a volume and claim

PVs are resources in the cluster. PVCs are requests for those resources and also act
as claim checks to the resource. The interaction between PVs and PVCs follows this lifecycle:

### Provisioning

There are two ways PVs may be provisioned: statically or dynamically.

#### Static

A cluster administrator creates a number of PVs. They carry the details of the
real storage, which is available for use by cluster users. They exist in the
Kubernetes API and are available for consumption.

#### Dynamic

When none of the static PVs the administrator created match a user's PersistentVolumeClaim,
the cluster may try to dynamically provision a volume specially for the PVC.
This provisioning is based on StorageClasses: the PVC must request a
[storage class](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/) and
the administrator must have created and configured that class for dynamic
provisioning to occur. Claims that request the class `""` effectively disable
dynamic provisioning for themselves.

To enable dynamic storage provisioning based on storage class, the cluster administrator
needs to enable the `DefaultStorageClass`
[admission controller](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#defaultstorageclass)
on the API server. This can be done, for example, by ensuring that `DefaultStorageClass` is
among the comma-delimited, ordered list of values for the `--enable-admission-plugins` flag of
the API server component. For more information on API server command-line flags,
check [kube-apiserver](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/) documentation.

### Binding

A user creates, or in the case of dynamic provisioning, has already created,
a PersistentVolumeClaim with a specific amount of storage requested and with
certain access modes. A control loop in the master watches for new PVCs, finds
a matching PV (if possible), and binds them together. If a PV was dynamically
provisioned for a new PVC, the loop will always bind that PV to the PVC. Otherwise,
the user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume may be in
excess of what was requested. Once bound, PersistentVolumeClaim binds are exclusive,
regardless of how they were bound. A PVC to PV binding is a one-to-one mapping,
using a ClaimRef which is a bi-directional binding between the PersistentVolume
and the PersistentVolumeClaim.

Claims will remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist.
Claims will be bound as matching volumes become available. For example, a
cluster provisioned with many 50Gi PVs would not match a PVC requesting 100Gi.
The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.

### Using

Pods use claims as volumes. The cluster inspects the claim to find the bound
volume and mounts that volume for a Pod. For volumes that support multiple
access modes, the user specifies which mode is desired when using their claim
as a volume in a Pod.

Once a user has a claim and that claim is bound, the bound PV belongs to the
user for as long as they need it. Users schedule Pods and access their claimed
PVs by including a `persistentVolumeClaim` section in a Pod's `volumes` block.
See [Claims As Volumes](#claims-as-volumes) for more details on this.

### Storage Object in Use Protection

The purpose of the Storage Object in Use Protection feature is to ensure that
PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) in active use by a Pod and PersistentVolume (PVs)
that are bound to PVCs are not removed from the system, as this may result in data loss.

{{< note >}}
PVC is in active use by a Pod when a Pod object exists that is using the PVC.
{{< /note >}}

If a user deletes a PVC in active use by a Pod, the PVC is not removed immediately.
PVC removal is postponed until the PVC is no longer actively used by any Pods. Also,
if an admin deletes a PV that is bound to a PVC, the PV is not removed immediately.
PV removal is postponed until the PV is no longer bound to a PVC.

You can see that a PVC is protected when the PVC's status is `Terminating` and the
`Finalizers` list includes `kubernetes.io/pvc-protection`:

```shell
kubectl describe pvc hostpath
Name:          hostpath
Namespace:     default
StorageClass:  example-hostpath
Status:        Terminating
Volume:
Labels:        <none>
Annotations:   volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class=example-hostpath
               volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner=example.com/hostpath
Finalizers:    [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection]
...
```

You can see that a PV is protected when the PV's status is `Terminating` and
the `Finalizers` list includes `kubernetes.io/pv-protection` too:

```shell
kubectl describe pv task-pv-volume
Name:            task-pv-volume
Labels:          type=local
Annotations:     <none>
Finalizers:      [kubernetes.io/pv-protection]
StorageClass:    standard
Status:          Terminating
Claim:
Reclaim Policy:  Delete
Access Modes:    RWO
Capacity:        1Gi
Message:
Source:
    Type:          HostPath (bare host directory volume)
    Path:          /tmp/data
    HostPathType:
Events:            <none>
```

### Reclaiming

When a user is done with their volume, they can delete the PVC objects from the
API that allows reclamation of the resource. The reclaim policy for a PersistentVolume
tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it has been released of its claim.
Currently, volumes can either be Retained, Recycled, or Deleted.

#### Retain

The `Retain` reclaim policy allows for manual reclamation of the resource.
When the PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, the PersistentVolume still exists
and the volume is considered "released". But it is not yet available for
another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume.
An administrator can manually reclaim the volume with the following steps.

1. Delete the PersistentVolume. The associated storage asset in external infrastructure
   (such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume) still exists after the PV is deleted.
1. Manually clean up the data on the associated storage asset accordingly.
1. Manually delete the associated storage asset.

If you want to reuse the same storage asset, create a new PersistentVolume with
the same storage asset definition.

#### Delete

For volume plugins that support the `Delete` reclaim policy, deletion removes
both the PersistentVolume object from Kubernetes, as well as the associated
storage asset in the external infrastructure, such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD,
Azure Disk, or Cinder volume. Volumes that were dynamically provisioned
inherit the [reclaim policy of their StorageClass](#reclaim-policy), which
defaults to `Delete`. The administrator should configure the StorageClass
according to users' expectations; otherwise, the PV must be edited or
patched after it is created. See
[Change the Reclaim Policy of a PersistentVolume](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/).

#### Recycle

{{< warning >}}
The `Recycle` reclaim policy is deprecated. Instead, the recommended approach
is to use dynamic provisioning.
{{< /warning >}}

If supported by the underlying volume plugin, the `Recycle` reclaim policy performs
a basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`) on the volume and makes it available again for a new claim.

However, an administrator can configure a custom recycler Pod template using
the Kubernetes controller manager command line arguments as described in the
[reference](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/).
The custom recycler Pod template must contain a `volumes` specification, as
shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pv-recycler
  namespace: default
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
  - name: vol
    hostPath:
      path: /any/path/it/will/be/replaced
  containers:
  - name: pv-recycler
    image: "registry.k8s.io/busybox"
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "test -e /scrub && rm -rf /scrub/..?* /scrub/.[!.]* /scrub/*  && test -z \"$(ls -A /scrub)\" || exit 1"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vol
      mountPath: /scrub
```

However, the particular path specified in the custom recycler Pod template in the
`volumes` part is replaced with the particular path of the volume that is being recycled.

### PersistentVolume deletion protection finalizer
{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.23" state="alpha" >}}

Finalizers can be added on a PersistentVolume to ensure that PersistentVolumes
having `Delete` reclaim policy are deleted only after the backing storage are deleted.

The newly introduced finalizers `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` and
`external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer`
are only added to dynamically provisioned volumes.

The finalizer `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` is added to in-tree plugin volumes.
The following is an example

```shell
kubectl describe pv pvc-74a498d6-3929-47e8-8c02-078c1ece4d78
Name:            pvc-74a498d6-3929-47e8-8c02-078c1ece4d78
Labels:          <none>
Annotations:     kubernetes.io/createdby: vsphere-volume-dynamic-provisioner
                 pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: yes
                 pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
Finalizers:      [kubernetes.io/pv-protection kubernetes.io/pv-controller]
StorageClass:    vcp-sc
Status:          Bound
Claim:           default/vcp-pvc-1
Reclaim Policy:  Delete
Access Modes:    RWO
VolumeMode:      Filesystem
Capacity:        1Gi
Node Affinity:   <none>
Message:         
Source:
    Type:               vSphereVolume (a Persistent Disk resource in vSphere)
    VolumePath:         [vsanDatastore] d49c4a62-166f-ce12-c464-020077ba5d46/kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-74a498d6-3929-47e8-8c02-078c1ece4d78.vmdk
    FSType:             ext4
    StoragePolicyName:  vSAN Default Storage Policy
Events:                 <none>
```

The finalizer `external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` is added for CSI volumes.
The following is an example:

```shell
Name:            pvc-2f0bab97-85a8-4552-8044-eb8be45cf48d
Labels:          <none>
Annotations:     pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: csi.vsphere.vmware.com
Finalizers:      [kubernetes.io/pv-protection external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer]
StorageClass:    fast
Status:          Bound
Claim:           demo-app/nginx-logs
Reclaim Policy:  Delete
Access Modes:    RWO
VolumeMode:      Filesystem
Capacity:        200Mi
Node Affinity:   <none>
Message:         
Source:
    Type:              CSI (a Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume source)
    Driver:            csi.vsphere.vmware.com
    FSType:            ext4
    VolumeHandle:      44830fa8-79b4-406b-8b58-621ba25353fd
    ReadOnly:          false
    VolumeAttributes:      storage.kubernetes.io/csiProvisionerIdentity=1648442357185-8081-csi.vsphere.vmware.com
                           type=vSphere CNS Block Volume
Events:                <none>
```

When the `CSIMigration{provider}` feature flag is enabled for a specific in-tree volume plugin,
the `kubernetes.io/pv-controller` finalizer is replaced by the
`external-provisioner.volume.kubernetes.io/finalizer` finalizer.

### Reserving a PersistentVolume

The control plane can [bind PersistentVolumeClaims to matching PersistentVolumes](#binding)
in the cluster. However, if you want a PVC to bind to a specific PV, you need to pre-bind them.

By specifying a PersistentVolume in a PersistentVolumeClaim, you declare a binding
between that specific PV and PVC. If the PersistentVolume exists and has not reserved
PersistentVolumeClaims through its `claimRef` field, then the PersistentVolume and
PersistentVolumeClaim will be bound.

The binding happens regardless of some volume matching criteria, including node affinity.
The control plane still checks that [storage class](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/),
access modes, and requested storage size are valid.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: foo-pvc
  namespace: foo
spec:
  storageClassName: "" # Empty string must be explicitly set otherwise default StorageClass will be set
  volumeName: foo-pv
  ...
```

This method does not guarantee any binding privileges to the PersistentVolume.
If other PersistentVolumeClaims could use the PV that you specify, you first
need to reserve that storage volume. Specify the relevant PersistentVolumeClaim
in the `claimRef` field of the PV so that other PVCs can not bind to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: foo-pv
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  claimRef:
    name: foo-pvc
    namespace: foo
  ...
```

This is useful if you want to consume PersistentVolumes that have their `claimPolicy` set
to `Retain`, including cases where you are reusing an existing PV.

### Expanding Persistent Volumes Claims

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

Support for expanding PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) is enabled by default. You can expand
the following types of volumes:

* azureDisk
* azureFile
* awsElasticBlockStore
* cinder (deprecated)
* {{< glossary_tooltip text="csi" term_id="csi" >}}
* flexVolume (deprecated)
* gcePersistentDisk
* rbd
* portworxVolume

You can only expand a PVC if its storage class's `allowVolumeExpansion` field is set to true.

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: example-vol-default
provisioner: vendor-name.example/magicstorage
parameters:
  resturl: "http://192.168.10.100:8080"
  restuser: ""
  secretNamespace: ""
  secretName: ""
allowVolumeExpansion: true
```

To request a larger volume for a PVC, edit the PVC object and specify a larger
size. This triggers expansion of the volume that backs the underlying PersistentVolume. A
new PersistentVolume is never created to satisfy the claim. Instead, an existing volume is resized.

{{< warning >}}
Directly editing the size of a PersistentVolume can prevent an automatic resize of that volume.
If you edit the capacity of a PersistentVolume, and then edit the `.spec` of a matching
PersistentVolumeClaim to make the size of the PersistentVolumeClaim match the PersistentVolume,
then no storage resize happens.
The Kubernetes control plane will see that the desired state of both resources matches,
conclude that the backing volume size has been manually
increased and that no resize is necessary.
{{< /warning >}}

#### CSI Volume expansion

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

Support for expanding CSI volumes is enabled by default but it also requires a
specific CSI driver to support volume expansion. Refer to documentation of the
specific CSI driver for more information.

#### Resizing a volume containing a file system

You can only resize volumes containing a file system if the file system is XFS, Ext3, or Ext4.

When a volume contains a file system, the file system is only resized when a new Pod is using
the PersistentVolumeClaim in `ReadWrite` mode. File system expansion is either done when a Pod is starting up
or when a Pod is running and the underlying file system supports online expansion.

FlexVolumes (deprecated since Kubernetes v1.23) allow resize if the driver is configured with the
`RequiresFSResize` capability to `true`. The FlexVolume can be resized on Pod restart.

#### Resizing an in-use PersistentVolumeClaim

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

In this case, you don't need to delete and recreate a Pod or deployment that is using an existing PVC.
Any in-use PVC automatically becomes available to its Pod as soon as its file system has been expanded.
This feature has no effect on PVCs that are not in use by a Pod or deployment. You must create a Pod that
uses the PVC before the expansion can complete.

Similar to other volume types - FlexVolume volumes can also be expanded when in-use by a Pod.

{{< note >}}
FlexVolume resize is possible only when the underlying driver supports resize.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
Expanding EBS volumes is a time-consuming operation.
Also, there is a per-volume quota of one modification every 6 hours.
{{< /note >}}

#### Recovering from Failure when Expanding Volumes

If a user specifies a new size that is too big to be satisfied by underlying
storage system, expansion of PVC will be continuously retried until user or
cluster administrator takes some action. This can be undesirable and hence
Kubernetes provides following methods of recovering from such failures.

{{< tabs name="recovery_methods" >}}
{{% tab name="Manually with Cluster Administrator access" %}}

If expanding underlying storage fails, the cluster administrator can manually
recover the Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) state and cancel the resize requests.
Otherwise, the resize requests are continuously retried by the controller without
administrator intervention.

1. Mark the PersistentVolume(PV) that is bound to the PersistentVolumeClaim(PVC)
   with `Retain` reclaim policy.
2. Delete the PVC. Since PV has `Retain` reclaim policy - we will not lose any data
   when we recreate the PVC.
3. Delete the `claimRef` entry from PV specs, so as new PVC can bind to it.
   This should make the PV `Available`.
4. Re-create the PVC with smaller size than PV and set `volumeName` field of the
   PVC to the name of the PV. This should bind new PVC to existing PV.
5. Don't forget to restore the reclaim policy of the PV.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="By requesting expansion to smaller size" %}}
{{% feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.23" state="alpha" %}}

{{< note >}}
Recovery from failing PVC expansion by users is available as an alpha feature
since Kubernetes 1.23. The `RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure` feature must be
enabled for this feature to work. Refer to the
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
documentation for more information.
{{< /note >}}

If the feature gates `RecoverVolumeExpansionFailure` is
enabled in your cluster, and expansion has failed for a PVC, you can retry expansion with a
smaller size than the previously requested value. To request a new expansion attempt with a
smaller proposed size, edit `.spec.resources` for that PVC and choose a value that is less than the
value you previously tried.
This is useful if expansion to a higher value did not succeed because of capacity constraint.
If that has happened, or you suspect that it might have, you can retry expansion by specifying a
size that is within the capacity limits of underlying storage provider. You can monitor status of
resize operation by watching `.status.resizeStatus` and events on the PVC.

Note that,
although you can specify a lower amount of storage than what was requested previously,
the new value must still be higher than `.status.capacity`.
Kubernetes does not support shrinking a PVC to less than its current size.

## Types of Persistent Volumes

PersistentVolume types are implemented as plugins. Kubernetes currently supports the following plugins:

* [`cephfs`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#cephfs) - CephFS volume
* [`csi`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi) - Container Storage Interface (CSI)
* [`fc`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#fc) - Fibre Channel (FC) storage
* [`hostPath`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath) - HostPath volume
  (for single node testing only; WILL NOT WORK in a multi-node cluster;
  consider using `local` volume instead)
* [`iscsi`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#iscsi) - iSCSI (SCSI over IP) storage
* [`local`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) - local storage devices
  mounted on nodes.
* [`nfs`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs) - Network File System (NFS) storage
* [`rbd`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#rbd) - Rados Block Device (RBD) volume

The following types of PersistentVolume are deprecated.
This means that support is still available but will be removed in a future Kubernetes release.

* [`awsElasticBlockStore`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#awselasticblockstore) - AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
  (**deprecated** in v1.17)
* [`azureDisk`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#azuredisk) - Azure Disk
  (**deprecated** in v1.19)
* [`azureFile`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#azurefile) - Azure File
  (**deprecated** in v1.21)
* [`cinder`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#cinder) - Cinder (OpenStack block storage)
  (**deprecated** in v1.18)
* [`flexVolume`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#flexvolume) - FlexVolume
  (**deprecated** in v1.23)
* [`gcePersistentDisk`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#gcepersistentdisk) - GCE Persistent Disk
  (**deprecated** in v1.17)
* [`portworxVolume`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#portworxvolume) - Portworx volume
  (**deprecated** in v1.25)
* [`vsphereVolume`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#vspherevolume) - vSphere VMDK volume
  (**deprecated** in v1.19)

Older versions of Kubernetes also supported the following in-tree PersistentVolume types:

* `photonPersistentDisk` - Photon controller persistent disk.
  (**not available** starting v1.15)
* [`scaleIO`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#scaleio) - ScaleIO volume
  (**not available** starting v1.21)
* [`flocker`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#flocker) - Flocker storage
  (**not available** starting v1.25)
* [`quobyte`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#quobyte) - Quobyte volume
  (**not available** starting v1.25)
* [`storageos`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#storageos) - StorageOS volume
  (**not available** starting v1.25)

## Persistent Volumes

Each PV contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the volume.
The name of a PersistentVolume object must be a valid
[DNS subdomain name](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0003
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  storageClassName: slow
  mountOptions:
    - hard
    - nfsvers=4.1
  nfs:
    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
```

{{< note >}}
Helper programs relating to the volume type may be required for consumption of
a PersistentVolume within a cluster.  In this example, the PersistentVolume is
of type NFS and the helper program /sbin/mount.nfs is required to support the
mounting of NFS filesystems.
{{< /note >}}

### Capacity

Generally, a PV will have a specific storage capacity. This is set using the PV's
`capacity` attribute. Read the glossary term
[Quantity](/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-quantity) to understand the units
expected by `capacity`.

Currently, storage size is the only resource that can be set or requested.
Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, etc.

### Volume Mode

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.18" state="stable" >}}

Kubernetes supports two `volumeModes` of PersistentVolumes: `Filesystem` and `Block`.

`volumeMode` is an optional API parameter.
`Filesystem` is the default mode used when `volumeMode` parameter is omitted.

A volume with `volumeMode: Filesystem` is *mounted* into Pods into a directory. If the volume
is backed by a block device and the device is empty, Kubernetes creates a filesystem
on the device before mounting it for the first time.

You can set the value of `volumeMode` to `Block` to use a volume as a raw block device.
Such volume is presented into a Pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it.
This mode is useful to provide a Pod the fastest possible way to access a volume, without
any filesystem layer between the Pod and the volume. On the other hand, the application
running in the Pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
See [Raw Block Volume Support](#raw-block-volume-support)
for an example on how to use a volume with `volumeMode: Block` in a Pod.

### Access Modes

A PersistentVolume can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource
provider. As shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities
and each PV's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular
volume. For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific
NFS PV might be exported on the server as read-only. Each PV gets its own set of
access modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

The access modes are:

`ReadWriteOnce`
: the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. ReadWriteOnce access
  mode still can allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.

`ReadOnlyMany`
: the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.

`ReadWriteMany`
: the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

 `ReadWriteOncePod`
: {{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.27" state="beta" >}}
  the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. Use ReadWriteOncePod
  access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across whole cluster can
  read that PVC or write to it. This is only supported for CSI volumes and
  Kubernetes version 1.22+.

The blog article
[Introducing Single Pod Access Mode for PersistentVolumes](/blog/2021/09/13/read-write-once-pod-access-mode-alpha/)
covers this in more detail.

In the CLI, the access modes are abbreviated to:

* RWO - ReadWriteOnce
* ROX - ReadOnlyMany
* RWX - ReadWriteMany
* RWOP - ReadWriteOncePod

{{< note >}}
Kubernetes uses volume access modes to match PersistentVolumeClaims and PersistentVolumes.
In some cases, the volume access modes also constrain where the PersistentVolume can be mounted.
Volume access modes do **not** enforce write protection once the storage has been mounted.
Even if the access modes are specified as ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, or ReadWriteMany,
they don't set any constraints on the volume. For example, even if a PersistentVolume is
created as ReadOnlyMany, it is no guarantee that it will be read-only. If the access modes
are specified as ReadWriteOncePod, the volume is constrained and can be mounted on only a single Pod.
{{< /note >}}

> __Important!__ A volume can only be mounted using one access mode at a time,
> even if it supports many. For example, a GCEPersistentDisk can be mounted as

### Class

A PV can have a class, which is specified by setting the
`storageClassName` attribute to the name of a
[StorageClass](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/).
A PV of a particular class can only be bound to PVCs requesting
that class. A PV with no `storageClassName` has no class and can only be bound
to PVCs that request no particular class.

In the past, the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` was used instead
of the `storageClassName` attribute. This annotation is still working; however,
it will become fully deprecated in a future Kubernetes release.

### Reclaim Policy

Current reclaim policies are:

* Retain -- manual reclamation
* Recycle -- basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`)
* Delete -- associated storage asset such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk,
  or OpenStack Cinder volume is deleted

Currently, only NFS and HostPath support recycling. AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk,
and Cinder volumes support deletion.

### Mount Options

A Kubernetes administrator can specify additional mount options for when a
Persistent Volume is mounted on a node.

{{< note >}}
Not all Persistent Volume types support mount options.
{{< /note >}}

The following volume types support mount options:

* `awsElasticBlockStore`
* `azureDisk`
* `azureFile`
* `cephfs`
* `cinder` (**deprecated** in v1.18)
* `gcePersistentDisk`
* `iscsi`
* `nfs`
* `rbd`
* `vsphereVolume`

Mount options are not validated. If a mount option is invalid, the mount fails.

In the past, the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options` was used instead
of the `mountOptions` attribute. This annotation is still working; however,
it will become fully deprecated in a future Kubernetes release.

### Node Affinity

{{< note >}}
For most volume types, you do not need to set this field. It is automatically
populated for [AWS EBS](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#awselasticblockstore),
[GCE PD](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#gcepersistentdisk) and
[Azure Disk](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#azuredisk) volume block types. You
need to explicitly set this for [local](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) volumes.
{{< /note >}}

A PV can specify node affinity to define constraints that limit what nodes this
volume can be accessed from. Pods that use a PV will only be scheduled to nodes
that are selected by the node affinity. To specify node affinity, set
`nodeAffinity` in the `.spec` of a PV. The
[PersistentVolume](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/config-and-storage-resources/persistent-volume-v1/#PersistentVolumeSpec)
API reference has more details on this field.

### Phase

A volume will be in one of the following phases:

* Available -- a free resource that is not yet bound to a claim
* Bound -- the volume is bound to a claim
* Released -- the claim has been deleted, but the resource is not yet reclaimed by the cluster
* Failed -- the volume has failed its automatic reclamation

The CLI will show the name of the PVC bound to the PV.

## PersistentVolumeClaims

Each PVC contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the claim.
The name of a PersistentVolumeClaim object must be a valid
[DNS subdomain name](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
  storageClassName: slow
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      release: "stable"
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [dev]}
```

### Access Modes

Claims use [the same conventions as volumes](#access-modes) when requesting
storage with specific access modes.

### Volume Modes

Claims use [the same convention as volumes](#volume-mode) to indicate the
consumption of the volume as either a filesystem or block device.

### Resources

Claims, like Pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case,
the request is for storage. The same
[resource model](https://git.k8s.io/design-proposals-archive/scheduling/resources.md)
applies to both volumes and claims.

### Selector

Claims can specify a
[label selector](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors)
to further filter the set of volumes. Only the volumes whose labels match the selector
can be bound to the claim. The selector can consist of two fields:

* `matchLabels` - the volume must have a label with this value
* `matchExpressions` - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values,
  and operator that relates the key and values. Valid operators include In, NotIn,
  Exists, and DoesNotExist.

All of the requirements, from both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`, are
ANDed together – they must all be satisfied in order to match.

### Class

A claim can request a particular class by specifying the name of a
[StorageClass](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
using the attribute `storageClassName`.
Only PVs of the requested class, ones with the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can
be bound to the PVC.

PVCs don't necessarily have to request a class. A PVC with its `storageClassName` set
equal to `""` is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it
can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to
`""`). A PVC with no `storageClassName` is not quite the same and is treated differently
by the cluster, depending on whether the
[`DefaultStorageClass` admission plugin](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#defaultstorageclass)
is turned on.

* If the admission plugin is turned on, the administrator may specify a
  default StorageClass. All PVCs that have no `storageClassName` can be bound only to
  PVs of that default. Specifying a default StorageClass is done by setting the
  annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` equal to `true` in
  a StorageClass object. If the administrator does not specify a default, the
  cluster responds to PVC creation as if the admission plugin were turned off. If
  more than one default is specified, the admission plugin forbids the creation of
  all PVCs.
* If the admission plugin is turned off, there is no notion of a default
  StorageClass. All PVCs that have `storageClassName` set to `""` can be
  bound only to PVs that have `storageClassName` also set to `""`.
  However, PVCs with missing `storageClassName` can be updated later once
  default StorageClass becomes available. If the PVC gets updated it will no
  longer bind to PVs that have `storageClassName` also set to `""`.

See [retroactive default StorageClass assignment](#retroactive-default-storageclass-assignment) for more details.

Depending on installation method, a default StorageClass may be deployed
to a Kubernetes cluster by addon manager during installation.

When a PVC specifies a `selector` in addition to requesting a StorageClass,
the requirements are ANDed together: only a PV of the requested class and with
the requested labels may be bound to the PVC.

{{< note >}}
Currently, a PVC with a non-empty `selector` can't have a PV dynamically provisioned for it.
{{< /note >}}

In the past, the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` was used instead
of `storageClassName` attribute. This annotation is still working; however,
it won't be supported in a future Kubernetes release.

#### Retroactive default StorageClass assignment

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="beta" >}}

You can create a PersistentVolumeClaim without specifying a `storageClassName`
for the new PVC, and you can do so even when no default StorageClass exists
in your cluster. In this case, the new PVC creates as you defined it, and the
`storageClassName` of that PVC remains unset until default becomes available.

When a default StorageClass becomes available, the control plane identifies any
existing PVCs without `storageClassName`. For the PVCs that either have an empty
value for `storageClassName` or do not have this key, the control plane then
updates those PVCs to set `storageClassName` to match the new default StorageClass.
If you have an existing PVC where the `storageClassName` is `""`, and you configure
a default StorageClass, then this PVC will not get updated.

In order to keep binding to PVs with `storageClassName` set to `""`
(while a default StorageClass is present), you need to set the `storageClassName`
of the associated PVC to `""`.

This behavior helps administrators change default StorageClass by removing the
old one first and then creating or setting another one. This brief window while
there is no default causes PVCs without `storageClassName` created at that time
to not have any default, but due to the retroactive default StorageClass
assignment this way of changing defaults is safe.

## Claims As Volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the Pod using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the
Pod's namespace and uses it to get the PersistentVolume backing the claim.
The volume is then mounted to the host and into the Pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim
```

### A Note on Namespaces

PersistentVolumes binds are exclusive, and since PersistentVolumeClaims are
namespaced objects, mounting claims with "Many" modes (`ROX`, `RWX`) is only
possible within one namespace.

### PersistentVolumes typed `hostPath`

A `hostPath` PersistentVolume uses a file or directory on the Node to emulate
network-attached storage. See
[an example of `hostPath` typed volume](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/#create-a-persistentvolume).

## Raw Block Volume Support

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.18" state="stable" >}}

The following volume plugins support raw block volumes, including dynamic provisioning where
applicable:

* AWSElasticBlockStore
* AzureDisk
* CSI
* FC (Fibre Channel)
* GCEPersistentDisk
* iSCSI
* Local volume
* OpenStack Cinder
* RBD (Ceph Block Device)
* VsphereVolume

### PersistentVolume using a Raw Block Volume {#persistent-volume-using-a-raw-block-volume}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: block-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  fc:
    targetWWNs: ["50060e801049cfd1"]
    lun: 0
    readOnly: false
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim requesting a Raw Block Volume {#persistent-volume-claim-requesting-a-raw-block-volume}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: block-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  volumeMode: Block
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

### Pod specification adding Raw Block Device path in container

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-block-volume
spec:
  containers:
    - name: fc-container
      image: fedora:26
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
      args: [ "tail -f /dev/null" ]
      volumeDevices:
        - name: data
          devicePath: /dev/xvda
  volumes:
    - name: data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: block-pvc
```

{{< note >}}
When adding a raw block device for a Pod, you specify the device path in the
container instead of a mount path.
{{< /note >}}

### Binding Block Volumes

If a user requests a raw block volume by indicating this using the `volumeMode`
field in the PersistentVolumeClaim spec, the binding rules differ slightly from
previous releases that didn't consider this mode as part of the spec.
Listed is a table of possible combinations the user and admin might specify for
requesting a raw block device. The table indicates if the volume will be bound or
not given the combinations: Volume binding matrix for statically provisioned volumes:

| PV volumeMode | PVC volumeMode  | Result           |
| --------------|:---------------:| ----------------:|
|   unspecified | unspecified     | BIND             |
|   unspecified | Block           | NO BIND          |
|   unspecified | Filesystem      | BIND             |
|   Block       | unspecified     | NO BIND          |
|   Block       | Block           | BIND             |
|   Block       | Filesystem      | NO BIND          |
|   Filesystem  | Filesystem      | BIND             |
|   Filesystem  | Block           | NO BIND          |
|   Filesystem  | unspecified     | BIND             |

{{< note >}}
Only statically provisioned volumes are supported for alpha release. Administrators
should take care to consider these values when working with raw block devices.
{{< /note >}}

## Volume Snapshot and Restore Volume from Snapshot Support

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.20" state="stable" >}}

Volume snapshots only support the out-of-tree CSI volume plugins.
For details, see [Volume Snapshots](/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/).
In-tree volume plugins are deprecated. You can read about the deprecated volume
plugins in the
[Volume Plugin FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-storage/volume-plugin-faq.md).

### Create a PersistentVolumeClaim from a Volume Snapshot {#create-persistent-volume-claim-from-volume-snapshot}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: restore-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: csi-hostpath-sc
  dataSource:
    name: new-snapshot-test
    kind: VolumeSnapshot
    apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

## Volume Cloning

[Volume Cloning](/docs/concepts/storage/volume-pvc-datasource/)
only available for CSI volume plugins.

### Create PersistentVolumeClaim from an existing PVC {#create-persistent-volume-claim-from-an-existing-pvc}

```yaml

```

## Volume populators and data sources

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="beta" >}}

Kubernetes supports custom volume populators.
To use custom volume populators, you must enable the `AnyVolumeDataSource`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) for
the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager.

Volume populators take advantage of a PVC spec field called `dataSourceRef`. Unlike the
`dataSource` field, which can only contain either a reference to another PersistentVolumeClaim
or to a VolumeSnapshot, the `dataSourceRef` field can contain a reference to any object in the
same namespace, except for core objects other than PVCs. For clusters that have the feature
gate enabled, use of the `dataSourceRef` is preferred over `dataSource`.

## Cross namespace data sources

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="alpha" >}}

Kubernetes supports cross namespace volume data sources.
To use cross namespace volume data sources, you must enable the `AnyVolumeDataSource`
and `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource`
[feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) for
the kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager.
Also, you must enable the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature gate for the csi-provisioner.

Enabling the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature gate allows you to specify
a namespace in the dataSourceRef field.

{{< note >}}
When you specify a namespace for a volume data source, Kubernetes checks for a
ReferenceGrant in the other namespace before accepting the reference.
ReferenceGrant is part of the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` extension APIs.
See [ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/)
in the Gateway API documentation for details.
This means that you must extend your Kubernetes cluster with at least ReferenceGrant from the
Gateway API before you can use this mechanism.
{{< /note >}}

## Data source references

The `dataSourceRef` field behaves almost the same as the `dataSource` field. If one is
specified while the other is not, the API server will give both fields the same value. Neither
field can be changed after creation, and attempting to specify different values for the two
fields will result in a validation error. Therefore the two fields will always have the same
contents.

There are two differences between the `dataSourceRef` field and the `dataSource` field that
users should be aware of:

* The `dataSource` field ignores invalid values (as if the field was blank) while the
  `dataSourceRef` field never ignores values and will cause an error if an invalid value is
  used. Invalid values are any core object (objects with no apiGroup) except for PVCs.
* The `dataSourceRef` field may contain different types of objects, while the `dataSource` field
  only allows PVCs and VolumeSnapshots.

When the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature is enabled, there are additional differences:

* The `dataSource` field only allows local objects, while the `dataSourceRef` field allows
  objects in any namespaces.  
* When namespace is specified, `dataSource` and `dataSourceRef` are not synced.

Users should always use `dataSourceRef` on clusters that have the feature gate enabled, and
fall back to `dataSource` on clusters that do not. It is not necessary to look at both fields
under any circumstance. The duplicated values with slightly different semantics exist only for
backwards compatibility. In particular, a mixture of older and newer controllers are able to
interoperate because the fields are the same.

### Using volume populators

Volume populators are {{< glossary_tooltip text="controllers" term_id="controller" >}} that can
create non-empty volumes, where the contents of the volume are determined by a Custom Resource.
Users create a populated volume by referring to a Custom Resource using the `dataSourceRef` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: populated-pvc
spec:
  dataSourceRef:
    name: example-name
    kind: ExampleDataSource
    apiGroup: example.storage.k8s.io
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Because volume populators are external components, attempts to create a PVC that uses one
can fail if not all the correct components are installed. External controllers should generate
events on the PVC to provide feedback on the status of the creation, including warnings if
the PVC cannot be created due to some missing component.

You can install the alpha [volume data source validator](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/volume-data-source-validator)
controller into your cluster. That controller generates warning Events on a PVC in the case that no populator
is registered to handle that kind of data source. When a suitable populator is installed for a PVC, it's the
responsibility of that populator controller to report Events that relate to volume creation and issues during
the process.

### Using a cross-namespace volume data source

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="alpha" >}}

Create a ReferenceGrant to allow the namespace owner to accept the reference.
You define a populated volume by specifying a cross namespace volume data source
using the `dataSourceRef` field. You must already have a valid ReferenceGrant
in the source namespace:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: ReferenceGrant
   metadata:
     name: allow-ns1-pvc
     namespace: default
   spec:
     from:
     - group: ""
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       namespace: ns1
     to:
     - group: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
       kind: VolumeSnapshot
       name: new-snapshot-demo
   ```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: foo-pvc
     namespace: ns1
   spec:
     storageClassName: example
     accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
     dataSourceRef:
       apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
       kind: VolumeSnapshot
       name: new-snapshot-demo
       namespace: default
     volumeMode: Filesystem
   ```

## Writing Portable Configuration

If you're writing configuration templates or examples that run on a wide range of clusters
and need persistent storage, it is recommended that you use the following pattern:

- Include PersistentVolumeClaim objects in your bundle of config (alongside
  Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc).
- Do not include PersistentVolume objects in the config, since the user instantiating
  the config may not have permission to create PersistentVolumes.
- Give the user the option of providing a storage class name when instantiating
  the template.
  - If the user provides a storage class name, put that value into the
    `persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName` field.
    This will cause the PVC to match the right storage
    class if the cluster has StorageClasses enabled by the admin.
  - If the user does not provide a storage class name, leave the
    `persistentVolumeClaim.storageClassName` field as nil. This will cause a
    PV to be automatically provisioned for the user with the default StorageClass
    in the cluster. Many cluster environments have a default StorageClass installed,
    or administrators can create their own default StorageClass.
- In your tooling, watch for PVCs that are not getting bound after some time
  and surface this to the user, as this may indicate that the cluster has no
  dynamic storage support (in which case the user should create a matching PV)
