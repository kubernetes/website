title: Volume Snapshot Classes
content_type: concept

<!-- overview -->

This document describes the concept of VolumeSnapshotClass in Kubernetes. Familiarity
with [volume snapshots](/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/) and
[storage classes](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes) is suggested.




<!-- body -->

## Introduction

Just like StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes"
of storage they offer when provisioning a volume, VolumeSnapshotClass provides a
way to describe the "classes" of storage when provisioning a volume snapshot.

## The VolumeSnapshotClass Resource

Each VolumeSnapshotClass contains the fields `driver`, `deletionPolicy`, and `parameters`,
which are used when a VolumeSnapshot belonging to the class needs to be
dynamically provisioned.

The name of a VolumeSnapshotClass object is significant, and is how users can
request a particular class. Administrators set the name and other parameters
of a class when first creating VolumeSnapshotClass objects, and the objects cannot
be updated once they are created.

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-hostpath-snapclass
driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io
deletionPolicy: Delete
parameters:
```

Administrators can specify a default VolumeSnapshotClass for VolumeSnapshots
that don't request any particular class to bind to by adding the
`snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"` annotation:

```yaml
apiVersion: snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotClass
metadata:
  name: csi-hostpath-snapclass
  annotations:
    snapshot.storage.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
driver: hostpath.csi.k8s.io
deletionPolicy: Delete
parameters:
```

### Driver

Volume snapshot classes have a driver that determines what CSI volume plugin is
used for provisioning VolumeSnapshots. This field must be specified.

### DeletionPolicy

Volume snapshot classes have a deletionPolicy. It enables you to configure what happens to a VolumeSnapshotContent when the VolumeSnapshot object it is bound to is to be deleted. The deletionPolicy of a volume snapshot class can either be `Retain` or `Delete`. This field must be specified.

If the deletionPolicy is `Delete`, then the underlying storage snapshot will be deleted along with the VolumeSnapshotContent object. If the deletionPolicy is `Retain`, then both the underlying snapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent remain.

## Parameters

Volume snapshot classes have parameters that describe volume snapshots belonging to
the volume snapshot class. Different parameters may be accepted depending on the
`driver`.
