<!-- overview -->

On-disk files in a container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for
non-trivial applications when running in containers. One problem
is the loss of files when a container crashes. The kubelet restarts the container
but with a clean state. A second problem occurs when sharing files
between containers running together in a `Pod`.
The Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="volume" term_id="volume" >}} abstraction
solves both of these problems.
Familiarity with [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) is suggested.

<!-- body -->

## Background

Docker has a concept of
[volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/), though it is
somewhat looser and less managed. A Docker volume is a directory on
disk or in another container. Docker provides volume
drivers, but the functionality is somewhat limited.

Kubernetes supports many types of volumes. A {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pod" text="Pod" >}}
can use any number of volume types simultaneously.
Ephemeral volume types have a lifetime of a pod, but persistent volumes exist beyond
the lifetime of a pod. Consequently, a volume outlives any containers
that run within the pod, and data is preserved across container restarts. When a pod
ceases to exist, Kubernetes destroys ephemeral volumes; however, Kubernetes does not
destroy persistent volumes.

At its core, a volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which
is accessible to the containers in a pod. How that directory comes to be, the
medium that backs it, and the contents of it are determined by the particular
volume type used.

To use a volume, specify the volumes to provide for the Pod in `.spec.volumes`
and declare where to mount those volumes into containers in `.spec.containers[*].volumeMounts`.
A process in a container sees a filesystem view composed from their Docker
image and volumes. The [Docker image](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerimages/)
is at the root of the filesystem hierarchy. Volumes mount at the specified paths within
the image. Volumes can not mount onto other volumes or have hard links to
other volumes. Each Container in the Pod's configuration must independently specify where to
mount each volume.

## Types of Volumes {#volume-types}

Kubernetes supports several types of volumes.

### awsElasticBlockStore {#awselasticblockstore}

An `awsElasticBlockStore` volume mounts an Amazon Web Services (AWS)
[EBS volume](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) into your pod. Unlike
`emptyDir`, which is erased when a pod is removed, the contents of an EBS
volume are persisted and the volume is unmounted. This means that an
EBS volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.

{{< note >}}
You must create an EBS volume by using `aws ec2 create-volume` or the AWS API before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

There are some restrictions when using an `awsElasticBlockStore` volume:

* the nodes on which pods are running must be AWS EC2 instances
* those instances need to be in the same region and availability zone as the EBS volume
* EBS only supports a single EC2 instance mounting a volume

#### Creating an AWS EBS volume

Before you can use an EBS volume with a pod, you need to create it.

```shell
aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone=eu-west-1a --size=10 --volume-type=gp2
```

Make sure the zone matches the zone you brought up your cluster in. Check that the size and EBS volume
type are suitable for your use.

#### AWS EBS configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-ebs
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-ebs
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    # This AWS EBS volume must already exist.
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: "<volume id>"
      fsType: ext4
```

If the EBS volume is partitioned, you can supply the optional field `partition: "<partition number>"` to specify which parition to mount on.

#### AWS EBS CSI migration

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.17" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for `awsElasticBlockStore`, when enabled, redirects
all plugin operations from the existing in-tree plugin to the `ebs.csi.aws.com` Container
Storage Interface (CSI) driver. In order to use this feature, the [AWS EBS CSI
driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationAWS`
beta features must be enabled.

#### AWS EBS CSI migration complete

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.17" state="alpha" >}}

To disable the `awsElasticBlockStore` storage plugin from being loaded by the controller manager
and the kubelet, set the `CSIMigrationAWSComplete` flag to `true`. This feature requires the `ebs.csi.aws.com` Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver installed on all worker nodes.

### azureDisk {#azuredisk}

The `azureDisk` volume type mounts a Microsoft Azure [Data Disk](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/csi-storage-drivers) into a pod.

For more details, see the [`azureDisk` volume plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/azure_disk/README.md).

#### azureDisk CSI migration

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.19" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for `azureDisk`, when enabled, redirects all plugin operations
from the existing in-tree plugin to the `disk.csi.azure.com` Container
Storage Interface (CSI) Driver. In order to use this feature, the [Azure Disk CSI
Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azuredisk-csi-driver)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationAzureDisk`
features must be enabled.

### azureFile {#azurefile}

The `azureFile` volume type mounts a Microsoft Azure File volume (SMB 2.1 and 3.0)
into a pod.

For more details, see the [`azureFile` volume plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/azure_file/README.md).

#### azureFile CSI migration

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.21" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for `azureFile`, when enabled, redirects all plugin operations
from the existing in-tree plugin to the `file.csi.azure.com` Container
Storage Interface (CSI) Driver. In order to use this feature, the [Azure File CSI
Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationAzureFile`
[feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) must be enabled.

Azure File CSI driver does not support using same volume with different fsgroups, if Azurefile CSI migration is enabled, using same volume with different fsgroups won't be supported at all.

### cephfs

A `cephfs` volume allows an existing CephFS volume to be
mounted into your Pod. Unlike `emptyDir`, which is erased when a pod is
removed, the contents of a `cephfs` volume are preserved and the volume is merely
unmounted. This means that a `cephfs` volume can be pre-populated with data, and
that data can be shared between pods. The `cephfs` volume can be mounted by multiple
writers simultaneously.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own Ceph server running with the share exported before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

See the [CephFS example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/volumes/cephfs/) for more details.

### cinder

{{< note >}}
Kubernetes must be configured with the OpenStack cloud provider.
{{< /note >}}

The `cinder` volume type is used to mount the OpenStack Cinder volume into your pod.

#### Cinder volume configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-cinder
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-cinder-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-cinder
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    # This OpenStack volume must already exist.
    cinder:
      volumeID: "<volume id>"
      fsType: ext4
```

#### OpenStack CSI migration

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.18" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for Cinder, when enabled, redirects all plugin operations
from the existing in-tree plugin to the `cinder.csi.openstack.org` Container
Storage Interface (CSI) Driver. In order to use this feature, the [OpenStack Cinder CSI
Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/master/docs/cinder-csi-plugin/using-cinder-csi-plugin.md)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationOpenStack`
beta features must be enabled.

### configMap

A [ConfigMap](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
provides a way to inject configuration data into pods.
The data stored in a ConfigMap can be referenced in a volume of type
`configMap` and then consumed by containerized applications running in a pod.

When referencing a ConfigMap, you provide the name of the ConfigMap in the
volume. You can customize the path to use for a specific
entry in the ConfigMap. The following configuration shows how to mount
the `log-config` ConfigMap onto a Pod called `configmap-pod`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: busybox
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config-vol
          mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-vol
      configMap:
        name: log-config
        items:
          - key: log_level
            path: log_level
```

The `log-config` ConfigMap is mounted as a volume, and all contents stored in
its `log_level` entry are mounted into the Pod at path `/etc/config/log_level`.
Note that this path is derived from the volume's `mountPath` and the `path`
keyed with `log_level`.

{{< note >}}
* You must create a [ConfigMap](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
  before you can use it.

* A container using a ConfigMap as a [`subPath`](#using-subpath) volume mount will not
  receive ConfigMap updates.

* Text data is exposed as files using the UTF-8 character encoding. For other character encodings, use `binaryData`.
{{< /note >}}

### downwardAPI {#downwardapi}

A `downwardAPI` volume makes downward API data available to applications.
It mounts a directory and writes the requested data in plain text files.

{{< note >}}
A container using the downward API as a [`subPath`](#using-subpath) volume mount will not
receive downward API updates.
{{< /note >}}

See the [downward API example](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/) for more details.

### emptyDir {#emptydir}

An `emptyDir` volume is first created when a Pod is assigned to a node, and
exists as long as that Pod is running on that node. As the name says, the
`emptyDir` volume is initially empty. All containers in the Pod can read and write the same
files in the `emptyDir` volume, though that volume can be mounted at the same
or different paths in each container. When a Pod is removed from a node for
any reason, the data in the `emptyDir` is deleted permanently.

{{< note >}}
A container crashing does *not* remove a Pod from a node. The data in an `emptyDir` volume
is safe across container crashes.
{{< /note >}}

Some uses for an `emptyDir` are:

* scratch space, such as for a disk-based merge sort
* checkpointing a long computation for recovery from crashes
* holding files that a content-manager container fetches while a webserver
  container serves the data

Depending on your environment, `emptyDir` volumes are stored on whatever medium that backs the
node such as disk or SSD, or network storage. However, if you set the `emptyDir.medium` field
to `"Memory"`, Kubernetes mounts a tmpfs (RAM-backed filesystem) for you instead.
While tmpfs is very fast, be aware that unlike disks, tmpfs is cleared on
node reboot and any files you write count against your container's
memory limit.

{{< note >}}
If the `SizeMemoryBackedVolumes` [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) is enabled,
you can specify a size for memory backed volumes.  If no size is specified, memory
backed volumes are sized to 50% of the memory on a Linux host.
{{< /note>}}

#### emptyDir configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

### fc (fibre channel) {#fc}

An `fc` volume type allows an existing fibre channel block storage volume
to mount in a Pod. You can specify single or multiple target world wide names (WWNs)
using the parameter `targetWWNs` in your Volume configuration. If multiple WWNs are specified,
targetWWNs expect that those WWNs are from multi-path connections.

{{< note >}}
You must configure FC SAN Zoning to allocate and mask those LUNs (volumes) to the target WWNs
beforehand so that Kubernetes hosts can access them.
{{< /note >}}

See the [fibre channel example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/fibre_channel) for more details.

### flocker (deprecated) {#flocker}

[Flocker](https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker) is an open-source, clustered
container data volume manager. Flocker provides management
and orchestration of data volumes backed by a variety of storage backends.

A `flocker` volume allows a Flocker dataset to be mounted into a Pod. If the
dataset does not already exist in Flocker, it needs to be first created with the Flocker
CLI or by using the Flocker API. If the dataset already exists it will be
reattached by Flocker to the node that the pod is scheduled. This means data
can be shared between pods as required.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own Flocker installation running before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

See the [Flocker example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/flocker) for more details.

### gcePersistentDisk

A `gcePersistentDisk` volume mounts a Google Compute Engine (GCE)
[persistent disk](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks) (PD) into your Pod.
Unlike `emptyDir`, which is erased when a pod is removed, the contents of a PD are
preserved and the volume is merely unmounted. This means that a PD can be
pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.

{{< note >}}
You must create a PD using `gcloud` or the GCE API or UI before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

There are some restrictions when using a `gcePersistentDisk`:

* the nodes on which Pods are running must be GCE VMs
* those VMs need to be in the same GCE project and zone as the persistent disk

One feature of GCE persistent disk is concurrent read-only access to a persistent disk.
A `gcePersistentDisk` volume permits multiple consumers to simultaneously
mount a persistent disk as read-only. This means that you can pre-populate a PD with your dataset
and then serve it in parallel from as many Pods as you need. Unfortunately,
PDs can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode. Simultaneous
writers are not allowed.

Using a GCE persistent disk with a Pod controlled by a ReplicaSet will fail unless
the PD is read-only or the replica count is 0 or 1.

#### Creating a GCE persistent disk {#gce-create-persistent-disk}

Before you can use a GCE persistent disk with a Pod, you need to create it.

```shell
gcloud compute disks create --size=500GB --zone=us-central1-a my-data-disk
```

#### GCE persistent disk configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    # This GCE PD must already exist.
    gcePersistentDisk:
      pdName: my-data-disk
      fsType: ext4
```

#### Regional persistent disks

The [Regional persistent disks](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#repds)
feature allows the creation of persistent disks that are available in two zones
within the same region. In order to use this feature, the volume must be provisioned
as a PersistentVolume; referencing the volume directly from a pod is not supported.

#### Manually provisioning a Regional PD PersistentVolume

Dynamic provisioning is possible using a
[StorageClass for GCE PD](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#gce).
Before creating a PersistentVolume, you must create the persistent disk:

```shell
gcloud compute disks create --size=500GB my-data-disk
  --region us-central1
  --replica-zones us-central1-a,us-central1-b
```

#### Regional persistent disk configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: test-volume
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 400Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  gcePersistentDisk:
    pdName: my-data-disk
    fsType: ext4
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
          operator: In
          values:
          - us-central1-a
          - us-central1-b
```

#### GCE CSI migration

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.17" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for GCE PD, when enabled, redirects all plugin operations
from the existing in-tree plugin to the `pd.csi.storage.gke.io` Container
Storage Interface (CSI) Driver. In order to use this feature, the [GCE PD CSI
Driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gcp-compute-persistent-disk-csi-driver)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationGCE`
beta features must be enabled.

### gitRepo (deprecated) {#gitrepo}

{{< warning >}}
The `gitRepo` volume type is deprecated. To provision a container with a git repo, mount an [EmptyDir](#emptydir) into an InitContainer that clones the repo using git, then mount the [EmptyDir](#emptydir) into the Pod's container.
{{< /warning >}}

A `gitRepo` volume is an example of a volume plugin. This plugin
mounts an empty directory and clones a git repository into this directory
for your Pod to use.

Here is an example of a `gitRepo` volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: server
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /mypath
      name: git-volume
  volumes:
  - name: git-volume
    gitRepo:
      repository: "git@somewhere:me/my-git-repository.git"
      revision: "22f1d8406d464b0c0874075539c1f2e96c253775"
```

### glusterfs

A `glusterfs` volume allows a [Glusterfs](https://www.gluster.org) (an open
source networked filesystem) volume to be mounted into your Pod. Unlike
`emptyDir`, which is erased when a Pod is removed, the contents of a
`glusterfs` volume are preserved and the volume is merely unmounted. This
means that a glusterfs volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can
be shared between pods. GlusterFS can be mounted by multiple writers
simultaneously.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own GlusterFS installation running before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

See the [GlusterFS example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/volumes/glusterfs) for more details.

### hostPath {#hostpath}

A `hostPath` volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem
into your Pod. This is not something that most Pods will need, but it offers a
powerful escape hatch for some applications.

For example, some uses for a `hostPath` are:

* running a container that needs access to Docker internals; use a `hostPath`
  of `/var/lib/docker`
* running cAdvisor in a container; use a `hostPath` of `/sys`
* allowing a Pod to specify whether a given `hostPath` should exist prior to the
  Pod running, whether it should be created, and what it should exist as

In addition to the required `path` property, you can optionally specify a `type` for a `hostPath` volume.

The supported values for field `type` are:

| Value | Behavior |
|:------|:---------|
| | Empty string (default) is for backward compatibility, which means that no checks will be performed before mounting the hostPath volume. |
| `DirectoryOrCreate` | If nothing exists at the given path, an empty directory will be created there as needed with permission set to 0755, having the same group and ownership with Kubelet. |
| `Directory` | A directory must exist at the given path |
| `FileOrCreate` | If nothing exists at the given path, an empty file will be created there as needed with permission set to 0644, having the same group and ownership with Kubelet. |
| `File` | A file must exist at the given path |
| `Socket` | A UNIX socket must exist at the given path |
| `CharDevice` | A character device must exist at the given path |
| `BlockDevice` | A block device must exist at the given path |

Watch out when using this type of volume, because:

* Pods with identical configuration (such as created from a PodTemplate) may
  behave differently on different nodes due to different files on the nodes
* The files or directories created on the underlying hosts are only writable by root. You
  either need to run your process as root in a
  [privileged Container](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) or modify the file
  permissions on the host to be able to write to a `hostPath` volume

#### hostPath configuration example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath:
      # directory location on host
      path: /data
      # this field is optional
      type: Directory
```

{{< caution >}}
The `FileOrCreate` mode does not create the parent directory of the file. If the parent directory
of the mounted file does not exist, the pod fails to start. To ensure that this mode works,
you can try to mount directories and files separately, as shown in the
[`FileOrCreate`configuration](#hostpath-fileorcreate-example).
{{< /caution >}}

#### hostPath FileOrCreate configuration example {#hostpath-fileorcreate-example}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-webserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-webserver
    image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/local/aaa
      name: mydir
    - mountPath: /var/local/aaa/1.txt
      name: myfile
  volumes:
  - name: mydir
    hostPath:
      # Ensure the file directory is created.
      path: /var/local/aaa
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
  - name: myfile
    hostPath:
      path: /var/local/aaa/1.txt
      type: FileOrCreate
```

### iscsi

An `iscsi` volume allows an existing iSCSI (SCSI over IP) volume to be mounted
into your Pod. Unlike `emptyDir`, which is erased when a Pod is removed, the
contents of an `iscsi` volume are preserved and the volume is merely
unmounted. This means that an iscsi volume can be pre-populated with data, and
that data can be shared between pods.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own iSCSI server running with the volume created before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

A feature of iSCSI is that it can be mounted as read-only by multiple consumers
simultaneously. This means that you can pre-populate a volume with your dataset
and then serve it in parallel from as many Pods as you need. Unfortunately,
iSCSI volumes can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode.
Simultaneous writers are not allowed.

See the [iSCSI example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/volumes/iscsi) for more details.

### local

A `local` volume represents a mounted local storage device such as a disk,
partition or directory.

Local volumes can only be used as a statically created PersistentVolume. Dynamic
provisioning is not supported.

Compared to `hostPath` volumes, `local` volumes are used in a durable and
portable manner without manually scheduling pods to nodes. The system is aware
of the volume's node constraints by looking at the node affinity on the PersistentVolume.

However, `local` volumes are subject to the availability of the underlying
node and are not suitable for all applications. If a node becomes unhealthy,
then the `local` volume becomes inaccessible by the pod. The pod using this volume
is unable to run. Applications using `local` volumes must be able to tolerate this
reduced availability, as well as potential data loss, depending on the
durability characteristics of the underlying disk.

The following example shows a PersistentVolume using a `local` volume and
`nodeAffinity`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: example-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 100Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: local-storage
  local:
    path: /mnt/disks/ssd1
  nodeAffinity:
    required:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
          operator: In
          values:
          - example-node
```

You must set a PersistentVolume `nodeAffinity` when using `local` volumes.
The Kubernetes scheduler uses the PersistentVolume `nodeAffinity` to schedule
these Pods to the correct node.

PersistentVolume `volumeMode` can be set to "Block" (instead of the default
value "Filesystem") to expose the local volume as a raw block device.

When using local volumes, it is recommended to create a StorageClass with
`volumeBindingMode` set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`. For more details, see the
local [StorageClass](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/#local) example.
Delaying volume binding ensures that the PersistentVolumeClaim binding decision
will also be evaluated with any other node constraints the Pod may have,
such as node resource requirements, node selectors, Pod affinity, and Pod anti-affinity.

An external static provisioner can be run separately for improved management of
the local volume lifecycle. Note that this provisioner does not support dynamic
provisioning yet. For an example on how to run an external local provisioner,
see the [local volume provisioner user
guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-storage-local-static-provisioner).

{{< note >}}
The local PersistentVolume requires manual cleanup and deletion by the
user if the external static provisioner is not used to manage the volume
lifecycle.
{{< /note >}}

### nfs

An `nfs` volume allows an existing NFS (Network File System) share to be
mounted into a Pod. Unlike `emptyDir`, which is erased when a Pod is
removed, the contents of an `nfs` volume are preserved and the volume is merely
unmounted. This means that an NFS volume can be pre-populated with data, and
that data can be shared between pods. NFS can be mounted by multiple
writers simultaneously.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own NFS server running with the share exported before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

See the [NFS example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/nfs) for more details.

### persistentVolumeClaim {#persistentvolumeclaim}

A `persistentVolumeClaim` volume is used to mount a
[PersistentVolume](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) into a Pod. PersistentVolumeClaims
are a way for users to "claim" durable storage (such as a GCE PersistentDisk or an
iSCSI volume) without knowing the details of the particular cloud environment.

See the information about [PersistentVolumes](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) for more
details.

### portworxVolume {#portworxvolume}

A `portworxVolume` is an elastic block storage layer that runs hyperconverged with
Kubernetes. [Portworx](https://portworx.com/use-case/kubernetes-storage/) fingerprints storage
in a server, tiers based on capabilities, and aggregates capacity across multiple servers.
Portworx runs in-guest in virtual machines or on bare metal Linux nodes.

A `portworxVolume` can be dynamically created through Kubernetes or it can also
be pre-provisioned and referenced inside a Pod.
Here is an example Pod referencing a pre-provisioned Portworx volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-portworx-volume-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /mnt
      name: pxvol
  volumes:
  - name: pxvol
    # This Portworx volume must already exist.
    portworxVolume:
      volumeID: "pxvol"
      fsType: "<fs-type>"
```

{{< note >}}
Make sure you have an existing PortworxVolume with name `pxvol`
before using it in the Pod.
{{< /note >}}

For more details, see the [Portworx volume](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/portworx/README.md) examples.

### projected

A `projected` volume maps several existing volume sources into the same directory.

Currently, the following types of volume sources can be projected:

* [`secret`](#secret)
* [`downwardAPI`](#downwardapi)
* [`configMap`](#configmap)
* `serviceAccountToken`

All sources are required to be in the same namespace as the Pod. For more details,
see the [all-in-one volume design document](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/contributors/design-proposals/node/all-in-one-volume.md).

#### Example configuration with a secret, a downwardAPI, and a configMap {#example-configuration-secret-downwardapi-configmap}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: "/projected-volume"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: mysecret
          items:
            - key: username
              path: my-group/my-username
      - downwardAPI:
          items:
            - path: "labels"
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.labels
            - path: "cpu_limit"
              resourceFieldRef:
                containerName: container-test
                resource: limits.cpu
      - configMap:
          name: myconfigmap
          items:
            - key: config
              path: my-group/my-config
```

#### Example configuration: secrets with a non-default permission mode set {#example-configuration-secrets-nondefault-permission-mode}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: "/projected-volume"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: mysecret
          items:
            - key: username
              path: my-group/my-username
      - secret:
          name: mysecret2
          items:
            - key: password
              path: my-group/my-password
              mode: 511
```

Each projected volume source is listed in the spec under `sources`. The
parameters are nearly the same with two exceptions:

* For secrets, the `secretName` field has been changed to `name` to be consistent
  with ConfigMap naming.
* The `defaultMode` can only be specified at the projected level and not for each
  volume source. However, as illustrated above, you can explicitly set the `mode`
  for each individual projection.

When the `TokenRequestProjection` feature is enabled, you can inject the token
for the current [service account](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens)
into a Pod at a specified path. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: sa-token-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: token-vol
      mountPath: "/service-account"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: token-vol
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          audience: api
          expirationSeconds: 3600
          path: token
```

The example Pod has a projected volume containing the injected service account
token. This token can be used by a Pod's containers to access the Kubernetes API
server. The `audience` field contains the intended audience of the
token. A recipient of the token must identify itself with an identifier specified
in the audience of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. This field
is optional and it defaults to the identifier of the API server.

The `expirationSeconds` is the expected duration of validity of the service account
token. It defaults to 1 hour and must be at least 10 minutes (600 seconds). An administrator
can also limit its maximum value by specifying the `--service-account-max-token-expiration`
option for the API server. The `path` field specifies a relative path to the mount point
of the projected volume.

{{< note >}}
A container using a projected volume source as a [`subPath`](#using-subpath) volume mount will not
receive updates for those volume sources.
{{< /note >}}

### quobyte

A `quobyte` volume allows an existing [Quobyte](https://www.quobyte.com) volume to
be mounted into your Pod.

{{< note >}}
You must have your own Quobyte setup and running with the volumes
created before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

Quobyte supports the {{< glossary_tooltip text="Container Storage Interface" term_id="csi" >}}.
CSI is the recommended plugin to use Quobyte volumes inside Kubernetes. Quobyte's
GitHub project has [instructions](https://github.com/quobyte/quobyte-csi#quobyte-csi) for deploying Quobyte using CSI, along with examples.

### rbd

An `rbd` volume allows a
[Rados Block Device](https://ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/rbd/) (RBD) volume to mount into your
Pod. Unlike `emptyDir`, which is erased when a pod is removed, the contents of
an `rbd` volume are preserved and the volume is unmounted. This
means that a RBD volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can
be shared between pods.

{{< note >}}
You must have a Ceph installation running before you can use RBD.
{{< /note >}}

A feature of RBD is that it can be mounted as read-only by multiple consumers
simultaneously. This means that you can pre-populate a volume with your dataset
and then serve it in parallel from as many pods as you need. Unfortunately,
RBD volumes can only be mounted by a single consumer in read-write mode.
Simultaneous writers are not allowed.

See the [RBD example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/volumes/rbd)
for more details.

### scaleIO (deprecated) {#scaleio}

ScaleIO is a software-based storage platform that uses existing hardware to
create clusters of scalable shared block networked storage. The `scaleIO` volume
plugin allows deployed pods to access existing ScaleIO
volumes. For information about dynamically provisioning new volumes for
persistent volume claims, see
[ScaleIO persistent volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#scaleio).

{{< note >}}
You must have an existing ScaleIO cluster already setup and
running with the volumes created before you can use them.
{{< /note >}}

The following example is a Pod configuration with ScaleIO:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-0
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: pod-0
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: vol-0
  volumes:
  - name: vol-0
    scaleIO:
      gateway: https://localhost:443/api
      system: scaleio
      protectionDomain: sd0
      storagePool: sp1
      volumeName: vol-0
      secretRef:
        name: sio-secret
      fsType: xfs
```

For further details, see the [ScaleIO](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/{{< param "githubbranch" >}}/staging/volumes/scaleio) examples.

### secret

A `secret` volume is used to pass sensitive information, such as passwords, to
Pods. You can store secrets in the Kubernetes API and mount them as files for
use by pods without coupling to Kubernetes directly. `secret` volumes are
backed by tmpfs (a RAM-backed filesystem) so they are never written to
non-volatile storage.

{{< note >}}
You must create a Secret in the Kubernetes API before you can use it.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
A container using a Secret as a [`subPath`](#using-subpath) volume mount will not
receive Secret updates.
{{< /note >}}

For more details, see [Configuring Secrets](/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

### storageOS {#storageos}

A `storageos` volume allows an existing [StorageOS](https://www.storageos.com)
volume to mount into your Pod.

StorageOS runs as a container within your Kubernetes environment, making local
or attached storage accessible from any node within the Kubernetes cluster.
Data can be replicated to protect against node failure. Thin provisioning and
compression can improve utilization and reduce cost.

At its core, StorageOS provides block storage to containers, accessible from a file system.

The StorageOS Container requires 64-bit Linux and has no additional dependencies.
A free developer license is available.

{{< caution >}}
You must run the StorageOS container on each node that wants to
access StorageOS volumes or that will contribute storage capacity to the pool.
For installation instructions, consult the
[StorageOS documentation](https://docs.storageos.com).
{{< /caution >}}

The following example is a Pod configuration with StorageOS:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    name: redis
    role: master
  name: test-storageos-redis
spec:
  containers:
    - name: master
      image: kubernetes/redis:v1
      env:
        - name: MASTER
          value: "true"
      ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /redis-master-data
          name: redis-data
  volumes:
    - name: redis-data
      storageos:
        # The `redis-vol01` volume must already exist within StorageOS in the `default` namespace.
        volumeName: redis-vol01
        fsType: ext4
```

For more information about StorageOS, dynamic provisioning, and PersistentVolumeClaims, see the
[StorageOS examples](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/volumes/storageos).

### vsphereVolume {#vspherevolume}

{{< note >}}
You must configure the Kubernetes vSphere Cloud Provider. For cloudprovider
configuration, refer to the [vSphere Getting Started guide](https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/).
{{< /note >}}

A `vsphereVolume` is used to mount a vSphere VMDK volume into your Pod.  The contents
of a volume are preserved when it is unmounted. It supports both VMFS and VSAN datastore.

{{< note >}}
You must create vSphere VMDK volume using one of the following methods before using with a Pod.
{{< /note >}}

#### Creating a VMDK volume {#creating-vmdk-volume}

Choose one of the following methods to create a VMDK.

{{< tabs name="tabs_volumes" >}}
{{% tab name="Create using vmkfstools" %}}
First ssh into ESX, then use the following command to create a VMDK:

```shell
vmkfstools -c 2G /vmfs/volumes/DatastoreName/volumes/myDisk.vmdk
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Create using vmware-vdiskmanager" %}}
Use the following command to create a VMDK:

```shell
vmware-vdiskmanager -c -t 0 -s 40GB -a lsilogic myDisk.vmdk
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}

#### vSphere VMDK configuration example {#vsphere-vmdk-configuration}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-vmdk
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-vmdk
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    # This VMDK volume must already exist.
    vsphereVolume:
      volumePath: "[DatastoreName] volumes/myDisk"
      fsType: ext4
```

For more information, see the [vSphere volume](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/volumes/vsphere) examples.

#### vSphere CSI migration {#vsphere-csi-migration}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.19" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature for `vsphereVolume`, when enabled, redirects all plugin operations
from the existing in-tree plugin to the `csi.vsphere.vmware.com` {{< glossary_tooltip text="CSI" term_id="csi" >}} driver. In order to use this feature, the
[vSphere CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver)
must be installed on the cluster and the `CSIMigration` and `CSIMigrationvSphere`
[feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) must be enabled.

This also requires minimum vSphere vCenter/ESXi Version to be 7.0u1 and minimum HW Version to be VM version 15.

{{< note >}}
The following StorageClass parameters from the built-in `vsphereVolume` plugin are not supported by the vSphere CSI driver:

* `diskformat`
* `hostfailurestotolerate`
* `forceprovisioning`
* `cachereservation`
* `diskstripes`
* `objectspacereservation`
* `iopslimit`

Existing volumes created using these parameters will be migrated to the vSphere CSI driver,
but new volumes created by the vSphere CSI driver will not be honoring these parameters.
{{< /note >}}

#### vSphere CSI migration complete {#vsphere-csi-migration-complete}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.19" state="beta" >}}

To turn off the `vsphereVolume` plugin from being loaded by the controller manager and the kubelet, you need to set this feature flag to `true`. You must install a `csi.vsphere.vmware.com` {{< glossary_tooltip text="CSI" term_id="csi" >}} driver on all worker nodes.

## Using subPath {#using-subpath}

Sometimes, it is useful to share one volume for multiple uses in a single pod.
The `volumeMounts.subPath` property specifies a sub-path inside the referenced volume
instead of its root.

The following example shows how to configure a Pod with a LAMP stack (Linux Apache MySQL PHP)
using a single, shared volume. This sample `subPath` configuration is not recommended
for production use.

The PHP application's code and assets map to the volume's `html` folder and
the MySQL database is stored in the volume's `mysql` folder. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-lamp-site
spec:
    containers:
    - name: mysql
      image: mysql
      env:
      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
        value: "rootpasswd"
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
        name: site-data
        subPath: mysql
    - name: php
      image: php:7.0-apache
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/www/html
        name: site-data
        subPath: html
    volumes:
    - name: site-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: my-lamp-site-data
```

### Using subPath with expanded environment variables {#using-subpath-expanded-environment}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.17" state="stable" >}}

Use the `subPathExpr` field to construct `subPath` directory names from
downward API environment variables.
The `subPath` and `subPathExpr` properties are mutually exclusive.

In this example, a `Pod` uses `subPathExpr` to create a directory `pod1` within
the `hostPath` volume `/var/log/pods`.
The `hostPath` volume takes the `Pod` name from the `downwardAPI`.
The host directory `/var/log/pods/pod1` is mounted at `/logs` in the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container1
    env:
    - name: POD_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          apiVersion: v1
          fieldPath: metadata.name
    image: busybox
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "while [ true ]; do echo 'Hello'; sleep 10; done | tee -a /logs/hello.txt" ]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: workdir1
      mountPath: /logs
      subPathExpr: $(POD_NAME)
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
  - name: workdir1
    hostPath:
      path: /var/log/pods
```

## Resources

The storage media (such as Disk or SSD) of an `emptyDir` volume is determined by the
medium of the filesystem holding the kubelet root dir (typically
`/var/lib/kubelet`). There is no limit on how much space an `emptyDir` or
`hostPath` volume can consume, and no isolation between containers or between
pods.

To learn about requesting space using a resource specification, see
[how to manage resources](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

## Out-of-tree volume plugins

The out-of-tree volume plugins include
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Container Storage Interface" term_id="csi" >}} (CSI)
and FlexVolume. These plugins enable storage vendors to create custom storage plugins
without adding their plugin source code to the Kubernetes repository.

Previously, all volume plugins were "in-tree". The "in-tree" plugins were built, linked, compiled,
and shipped with the core Kubernetes binaries. This meant that adding a new storage system to
Kubernetes (a volume plugin) required checking code into the core Kubernetes code repository.

Both CSI and FlexVolume allow volume plugins to be developed independent of
the Kubernetes code base, and deployed (installed) on Kubernetes clusters as
extensions.

For storage vendors looking to create an out-of-tree volume plugin, please refer
to the [volume plugin FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-storage/volume-plugin-faq.md).

### csi

[Container Storage Interface](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md)
(CSI) defines a standard interface for container orchestration systems (like
Kubernetes) to expose arbitrary storage systems to their container workloads.

Please read the [CSI design proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/container-storage-interface.md) for more information.

{{< note >}}
Support for CSI spec versions 0.2 and 0.3 are deprecated in Kubernetes
v1.13 and will be removed in a future release.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
CSI drivers may not be compatible across all Kubernetes releases.
Please check the specific CSI driver's documentation for supported
deployments steps for each Kubernetes release and a compatibility matrix.
{{< /note >}}

Once a CSI compatible volume driver is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, users
may use the `csi` volume type to attach or mount the volumes exposed by the
CSI driver.

A `csi` volume can be used in a Pod in three different ways:

* through a reference to a [PersistentVolumeClaim](#persistentvolumeclaim)
* with a [generic ephemeral volume](/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volume)
(alpha feature)
* with a [CSI ephemeral volume](/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#csi-ephemeral-volume)
if the driver supports that (beta feature)

The following fields are available to storage administrators to configure a CSI
persistent volume:

* `driver`: A string value that specifies the name of the volume driver to use.
  This value must correspond to the value returned in the `GetPluginInfoResponse`
  by the CSI driver as defined in the [CSI spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#getplugininfo).
  It is used by Kubernetes to identify which CSI driver to call out to, and by
  CSI driver components to identify which PV objects belong to the CSI driver.
* `volumeHandle`: A string value that uniquely identifies the volume. This value
  must correspond to the value returned in the `volume.id` field of the
  `CreateVolumeResponse` by the CSI driver as defined in the [CSI spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#createvolume).
  The value is passed as `volume_id` on all calls to the CSI volume driver when
  referencing the volume.
* `readOnly`: An optional boolean value indicating whether the volume is to be
  "ControllerPublished" (attached) as read only. Default is false. This value is
  passed to the CSI driver via the `readonly` field in the
  `ControllerPublishVolumeRequest`.
* `fsType`: If the PV's `VolumeMode` is `Filesystem` then this field may be used
  to specify the filesystem that should be used to mount the volume. If the
  volume has not been formatted and formatting is supported, this value will be
  used to format the volume.
  This value is passed to the CSI driver via the `VolumeCapability` field of
  `ControllerPublishVolumeRequest`, `NodeStageVolumeRequest`, and
  `NodePublishVolumeRequest`.
* `volumeAttributes`: A map of string to string that specifies static properties
  of a volume. This map must correspond to the map returned in the
  `volume.attributes` field of the `CreateVolumeResponse` by the CSI driver as
  defined in the [CSI spec](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/spec.md#createvolume).
  The map is passed to the CSI driver via the `volume_context` field in the
  `ControllerPublishVolumeRequest`, `NodeStageVolumeRequest`, and
  `NodePublishVolumeRequest`.
* `controllerPublishSecretRef`: A reference to the secret object containing
  sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI
  `ControllerPublishVolume` and `ControllerUnpublishVolume` calls. This field is
  optional, and may be empty if no secret is required. If the Secret
  contains more than one secret, all secrets are passed.
* `nodeStageSecretRef`: A reference to the secret object containing
  sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI
  `NodeStageVolume` call. This field is optional, and may be empty if no secret
  is required. If the Secret contains more than one secret, all secrets
  are passed.
* `nodePublishSecretRef`: A reference to the secret object containing
  sensitive information to pass to the CSI driver to complete the CSI
  `NodePublishVolume` call. This field is optional, and may be empty if no
  secret is required. If the secret object contains more than one secret, all
  secrets are passed.

#### CSI raw block volume support

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.18" state="stable" >}}

Vendors with external CSI drivers can implement raw block volume support
in Kubernetes workloads.

You can set up your
[PersistentVolume/PersistentVolumeClaim with raw block volume support](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#raw-block-volume-support) as usual, without any CSI specific changes.

#### CSI ephemeral volumes

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.16" state="beta" >}}

You can directly configure CSI volumes within the Pod
specification. Volumes specified in this way are ephemeral and do not
persist across pod restarts. See [Ephemeral
Volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#csi-ephemeral-volume)
for more information.

For more information on how to develop a CSI driver, refer to the
[kubernetes-csi documentation](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/)

#### Migrating to CSI drivers from in-tree plugins

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.17" state="beta" >}}

The `CSIMigration` feature, when enabled, directs operations against existing in-tree
plugins to corresponding CSI plugins (which are expected to be installed and configured).
As a result, operators do not have to make any
configuration changes to existing Storage Classes, PersistentVolumes or PersistentVolumeClaims
(referring to in-tree plugins) when transitioning to a CSI driver that supersedes an in-tree plugin.

The operations and features that are supported include:
provisioning/delete, attach/detach, mount/unmount and resizing of volumes.

In-tree plugins that support `CSIMigration` and have a corresponding CSI driver implemented
are listed in [Types of Volumes](#volume-types).

### flexVolume

FlexVolume is an out-of-tree plugin interface that has existed in Kubernetes
since version 1.2 (before CSI). It uses an exec-based model to interface with
drivers. The FlexVolume driver binaries must be installed in a pre-defined volume
plugin path on each node and in some cases the control plane nodes as well.

Pods interact with FlexVolume drivers through the `flexvolume` in-tree volume plugin.
For more details, see the [FlexVolume](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-storage/flexvolume.md) examples.

## Mount propagation

Mount propagation allows for sharing volumes mounted by a container to
other containers in the same pod, or even to other pods on the same node.

Mount propagation of a volume is controlled by the `mountPropagation` field
in `Container.volumeMounts`. Its values are:

* `None` - This volume mount will not receive any subsequent mounts
  that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories by the host.
  In similar fashion, no mounts created by the container will be visible on
  the host. This is the default mode.

  This mode is equal to `private` mount propagation as described in the
  [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt)

* `HostToContainer` - This volume mount will receive all subsequent mounts
  that are mounted to this volume or any of its subdirectories.

  In other words, if the host mounts anything inside the volume mount, the
  container will see it mounted there.

  Similarly, if any Pod with `Bidirectional` mount propagation to the same
  volume mounts anything there, the container with `HostToContainer` mount
  propagation will see it.

  This mode is equal to `rslave` mount propagation as described in the
  [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt)

* `Bidirectional` - This volume mount behaves the same the `HostToContainer` mount.
  In addition, all volume mounts created by the container will be propagated
  back to the host and to all containers of all pods that use the same volume.

  A typical use case for this mode is a Pod with a FlexVolume or CSI driver or
  a Pod that needs to mount something on the host using a `hostPath` volume.

  This mode is equal to `rshared` mount propagation as described in the
  [Linux kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt)

  {{< warning >}}
  `Bidirectional` mount propagation can be dangerous. It can damage
  the host operating system and therefore it is allowed only in privileged
  containers. Familiarity with Linux kernel behavior is strongly recommended.
  In addition, any volume mounts created by containers in pods must be destroyed
  (unmounted) by the containers on termination.
  {{< /warning >}}

### Configuration

Before mount propagation can work properly on some deployments (CoreOS,
RedHat/Centos, Ubuntu) mount share must be configured correctly in
Docker as shown below.

Edit your Docker's `systemd` service file. Set `MountFlags` as follows:

```shell
MountFlags=shared
```

Or, remove `MountFlags=slave` if present. Then restart the Docker daemon:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
