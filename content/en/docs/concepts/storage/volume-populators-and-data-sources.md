<!-- overview -->

This document describes _volume populators_ and _data sources_ in Kubernetes.
Familiarity with [persistent volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
is suggested.

<!-- body -->

When you create a {{< glossary_tooltip text="PersistentVolumeClaim" term_id="persistent-volume-claim" >}},
the volume that Kubernetes provisions for it normally starts empty. A _data source_
lets you instead request that the new volume be pre-populated with existing data.
_Volume populators_ are the controllers that carry out that population, based on the
data source that the PersistentVolumeClaim references.

Kubernetes has built-in support for data sources that
[clone an existing volume](/docs/concepts/storage/volume-pvc-datasource/) or that
[restore a volume snapshot](/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots/). Custom volume
populators extend this mechanism. The data source is a custom resource, that is, an object
whose type is defined by a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="CustomResourceDefinition" term_id="CustomResourceDefinition" >}}.
A populator controller watches for PersistentVolumeClaims that reference such a resource
and fills the new volume from it.

## Volume populators and data sources

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="beta" >}}

Kubernetes supports custom volume populators.
To use custom volume populators, you must enable the `AnyVolumeDataSource`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) for
the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager.

Volume populators take advantage of a PVC spec field called `dataSourceRef`. Unlike the
`dataSource` field, which can only contain either a reference to another PersistentVolumeClaim
or to a VolumeSnapshot, the `dataSourceRef` field can contain a reference to any object in the
same namespace, except for core objects other than PVCs. For clusters that have the feature
gate enabled, use of the `dataSourceRef` is preferred over `dataSource`.

## Data source references

The `dataSourceRef` field behaves almost the same as the `dataSource` field. If one is
specified while the other is not, the API server will give both fields the same value. Neither
field can be changed after creation, and attempting to specify different values for the two
fields will result in a validation error. Therefore the two fields will always have the same
contents.

There are two differences between the `dataSourceRef` field and the `dataSource` field that
users should be aware of:

* The `dataSource` field ignores invalid values (as if the field was blank) while the
  `dataSourceRef` field never ignores values and will cause an error if an invalid value is
  used. Invalid values are any core object (objects with no apiGroup) except for PVCs.
* The `dataSourceRef` field may contain different types of objects, while the `dataSource` field
  only allows PVCs and VolumeSnapshots.

When the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature is enabled, there are additional differences:

* The `dataSource` field only allows local objects, while the `dataSourceRef` field allows
  objects in any namespaces.
* When namespace is specified, `dataSource` and `dataSourceRef` are not synced.

Users should always use `dataSourceRef` on clusters that have the feature gate enabled, and
fall back to `dataSource` on clusters that do not. It is not necessary to look at both fields
under any circumstance. The duplicated values with slightly different semantics exist only for
backwards compatibility. In particular, a mixture of older and newer controllers are able to
interoperate because the fields are the same.

### Using volume populators

Volume populators are {{< glossary_tooltip text="controllers" term_id="controller" >}} that can
create non-empty volumes, where the contents of the volume are determined by a Custom Resource.
Users create a populated volume by referring to a Custom Resource using the `dataSourceRef` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: populated-pvc
spec:
  dataSourceRef:
    name: example-name
    kind: ExampleDataSource
    apiGroup: example.storage.k8s.io
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

Because volume populators are external components, attempts to create a PVC that uses one
can fail if not all the correct components are installed. External controllers should generate
events on the PVC to provide feedback on the status of the creation, including warnings if
the PVC cannot be created due to some missing component.

You can install the alpha [volume data source validator](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/volume-data-source-validator)
controller into your cluster. That controller generates warning Events on a PVC in the case that no populator
is registered to handle that kind of data source. When a suitable populator is installed for a PVC, it's the
responsibility of that populator controller to report Events that relate to volume creation and issues during
the process.

## Cross namespace data sources

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="alpha" >}}

Kubernetes supports cross namespace volume data sources.
To use cross namespace volume data sources, you must enable the `AnyVolumeDataSource`
and `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource`
[feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/) for
the kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager.
Also, you must enable the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature gate for the csi-provisioner.

Enabling the `CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource` feature gate allows you to specify
a namespace in the dataSourceRef field.

{{< note >}}
When you specify a namespace for a volume data source, Kubernetes checks for a
ReferenceGrant in the other namespace before accepting the reference.
ReferenceGrant is part of the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` extension APIs.
See [ReferenceGrant](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/)
in the Gateway API documentation for details.
This means that you must extend your Kubernetes cluster with at least ReferenceGrant from the
Gateway API before you can use this mechanism.

### Using a cross-namespace volume data source

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="alpha" >}}

Create a ReferenceGrant to allow the namespace owner to accept the reference.
You define a populated volume by specifying a cross namespace volume data source
using the `dataSourceRef` field. You must already have a valid ReferenceGrant
in the source namespace:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
   kind: ReferenceGrant
   metadata:
     name: allow-ns1-pvc
     namespace: default
   spec:
     from:
     - group: ""
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       namespace: ns1
     to:
     - group: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
       kind: VolumeSnapshot
       name: new-snapshot-demo
   ```

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: foo-pvc
     namespace: ns1
   spec:
     storageClassName: example
     accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
     dataSourceRef:
       apiGroup: snapshot.storage.k8s.io
       kind: VolumeSnapshot
       name: new-snapshot-demo
       namespace: default
     volumeMode: Filesystem
   ```
