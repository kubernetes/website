title: "Scheduling, Preemption and Eviction"
weight: 90
description: >
  In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes
  so that the kubelet can run them. Preemption is the process of terminating 
  Pods with lower Priority so that Pods with higher Priority can schedule on 
  Nodes. Eviction is the process of proactively terminating one or more Pods on
  resource-starved Nodes.
