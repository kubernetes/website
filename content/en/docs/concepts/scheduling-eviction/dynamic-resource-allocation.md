<!-- overview -->

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="DynamicResourceAllocation" >}}

Dynamic resource allocation is an API for requesting and sharing resources
between pods and containers inside a pod. It is a generalization of the
persistent volumes API for generic resources. Typically those resources
are devices like GPUs.

Third-party resource drivers are
responsible for tracking and preparing resources, with allocation of
resources handled by Kubernetes via _structured parameters_ (introduced in Kubernetes 1.30).
Different kinds of resources support arbitrary parameters for defining requirements and
initialization.

Kubernetes v1.26 through to 1.31 included an (alpha) implementation of _classic DRA_,
which is no longer supported. This documentation, which is for Kubernetes
v{{< skew currentVersion >}}, explains the current approach to dynamic resource
allocation within Kubernetes.

## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

Kubernetes v{{< skew currentVersion >}} includes cluster-level API support for
dynamic resource allocation, but it [needs to be enabled](#enabling-dynamic-resource-allocation)
explicitly. You also must install a resource driver for specific resources that
are meant to be managed using this API. If you are not running Kubernetes
v{{< skew currentVersion>}}, check the documentation for that version of Kubernetes.

## API

The `resource.k8s.io/v1beta1`
{{< glossary_tooltip text="API group" term_id="api-group" >}} provides these types:

ResourceClaim
: Describes a request for access to resources in the cluster,
  for use by workloads. For example, if a workload needs an accelerator device
  with specific properties, this is how that request is expressed. The status
  stanza tracks whether this claim has been satisfied and what specific
  resources have been allocated.

ResourceClaimTemplate
: Defines the spec and some metadata for creating
  ResourceClaims. Created by a user when deploying a workload.
  The per-Pod ResourceClaims are then created and removed by Kubernetes
  automatically.

DeviceClass
: Contains pre-defined selection criteria for certain devices and
  configuration for them. DeviceClasses are created by a cluster administrator
  when installing a resource driver. Each request to allocate a device
  in a ResourceClaim must reference exactly one DeviceClass.

ResourceSlice
: Used by DRA drivers to publish information about resources
  that are available in the cluster.

All parameters that select devices are defined in the ResourceClaim and
DeviceClass with in-tree types. Configuration parameters can be embedded there.
Which configuration parameters are valid depends on the DRA driver -- Kubernetes
only passes them through without interpreting them.

The `core/v1` `PodSpec` defines ResourceClaims that are needed for a Pod in a
`resourceClaims` field. Entries in that list reference either a ResourceClaim
or a ResourceClaimTemplate. When referencing a ResourceClaim, all Pods using
this PodSpec (for example, inside a Deployment or StatefulSet) share the same
ResourceClaim instance. When referencing a ResourceClaimTemplate, each Pod gets
its own instance.

The `resources.claims` list for container resources defines whether a container gets
access to these resource instances, which makes it possible to share resources
between one or more containers.

Here is an example for a fictional resource driver. Two ResourceClaim objects
will get created for this Pod and each container gets access to one of them.

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: DeviceClass
name: resource.example.com
spec:
  selectors:
  - cel:
      expression: device.driver == "resource-driver.example.com"

  name: large-black-cat-claim-template

  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: req-0
        deviceClassName: resource.example.com
        selectors:
        - cel:
           expression: |-
              device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].color == "black" &&
              device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].size == "large"
–--
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-cats
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container0
    image: ubuntu:20.04
    command: ["sleep", "9999"]
    resources:
      claims:
      - name: cat-0
  - name: container1
    image: ubuntu:20.04
    command: ["sleep", "9999"]
    resources:
      claims:
      - name: cat-1
  resourceClaims:
  - name: cat-0
    resourceClaimTemplateName: large-black-cat-claim-template
  - name: cat-1
    resourceClaimTemplateName: large-black-cat-claim-template
```

## Scheduling

The scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to a ResourceClaim whenever a pod needs
them. It does so by retrieving the full list of available resources from
ResourceSlice objects, tracking which of those resources have already been
allocated to existing ResourceClaims, and then selecting from those resources
that remain.

The only kind of supported resources at the moment are devices. A device
instance has a name and several attributes and capacities. Devices get selected
through CEL expressions which check those attributes and capacities. In
addition, the set of selected devices also can be restricted to sets which meet
certain constraints.

The chosen resource is recorded in the ResourceClaim status together with any
vendor-specific configuration, so when a pod is about to start on a node, the
resource driver on the node has all the information it needs to prepare the
resource.

By using structured parameters, the scheduler is able to reach a decision
without communicating with any DRA resource drivers. It is also able to
schedule multiple pods quickly by keeping information about ResourceClaim
allocations in memory and writing this information to the ResourceClaim objects
in the background while concurrently binding the pod to a node.

## Monitoring resources

The kubelet provides a gRPC service to enable discovery of dynamic resources of
running Pods. For more information on the gRPC endpoints, see the
[resource allocation reporting](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/#monitoring-device-plugin-resources).

## Pre-scheduled Pods

When you - or another API client - create a Pod with `spec.nodeName` already set, the scheduler gets bypassed.
If some ResourceClaim needed by that Pod does not exist yet, is not allocated
or not reserved for the Pod, then the kubelet will fail to run the Pod and
re-check periodically because those requirements might still get fulfilled
later.

Such a situation can also arise when support for dynamic resource allocation
was not enabled in the scheduler at the time when the Pod got scheduled
(version skew, configuration, feature gate, etc.). kube-controller-manager
detects this and tries to make the Pod runnable by reserving the required
ResourceClaims. However, this only works if those were allocated by
the scheduler for some other pod.

It is better to avoid bypassing the scheduler because a Pod that is assigned to a node
blocks normal resources (RAM, CPU) that then cannot be used for other Pods
while the Pod is stuck. To make a Pod run on a specific node while still going
through the normal scheduling flow, create the Pod with a node selector that
exactly matches the desired node:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-cats
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: name-of-the-intended-node
  ...
```

You may also be able to mutate the incoming Pod, at admission time, to unset
the `.spec.nodeName` field and to use a node selector instead.

## Admin access

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="DRAAdminAccess" >}}

You can mark a request in a ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate as having
privileged features for maintenance and troubleshooting tasks. A request with
admin access grants access to in-use devices and may enable additional
permissions when making the device available in a container:

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: large-black-cat-claim-template
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: req-0
        deviceClassName: resource.example.com
        allocationMode: All
        adminAccess: true
```

If this feature is disabled, the `adminAccess` field will be removed
automatically when creating such a ResourceClaim.

Admin access is a privileged mode and should not be granted to regular users in
multi-tenant clusters. Starting with Kubernetes v1.33, only users authorized to
create ResourceClaim or ResourceClaimTemplate objects in namespaces labeled with
`resource.k8s.io/admin-access: "true"` (case-sensitive) can use the
`adminAccess` field. This ensures that non-admin users cannot misuse the
feature. 

## ResourceClaim Device Status

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="DRAResourceClaimDeviceStatus" >}}

The drivers can report driver-specific device status data for each allocated device
in a resource claim. For example, IPs assigned to a network interface device can be 
reported in the ResourceClaim status.

The drivers setting the status, the accuracy of the information depends on the implementation 
of those DRA Drivers. Therefore, the reported status of the device may not always reflect the 
real time changes of the state of the device.

When the feature is disabled, that field automatically gets cleared when storing the ResourceClaim. 

A ResourceClaim device status is supported when it is possible, from a DRA driver, to update an 
existing ResourceClaim where the `status.devices` field is set.

## Prioritized List

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="DRAPrioritizedList" >}}

You can provide a prioritized list of subrequests for requests in a ResourceClaim. The
scheduler will then select the first subrequest that can be allocated. This allows users to
specify alternative devices that can be used by the workload if the primary choice is not
available.

In the example below, the ResourceClaimTemplate requested a device with the color black
and the size large. If a device with those attributes are not available, the pod can not
be scheduled. With the priotized list feature, a second alternative can be specified, which
requests two devices with the color white and size small. The large black device will be
allocated if it is available. But if it is not and two small white devices are available,
the pod will still be able to run.

```yaml
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ResourceClaimTemplate
metadata:
  name: prioritized-list-claim-template
spec:
  spec:
    devices:
      requests:
      - name: req-0
        firstAvailable:
        - name: large-black
          deviceClassName: resource.example.com
          selectors:
          - cel:
              expression: |-
                device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].color == "black" &&
                device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].size == "large"
        - name: small-white
          deviceClassName: resource.example.com
          selectors:
          - cel:
              expression: |-
                device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].color == "white" &&
                device.attributes["resource-driver.example.com"].size == "small"
          count: 2
```

## Partitionable Devices

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="DRAPartitionableDevices" >}}

Devices represented in DRA don't necessarily have to be a single unit connected to a single machine,
but can also be a logical device comprised of multiple devices connected to multiple machines. These
devices might consume overlapping resources of the underlying phyical devices, meaning that when one
logical device is allocated other devices will no longer be available.

In the ResourceSlice API, this is represented as a list of named CounterSets, each of which
contains a set of named counters. The counters represent the resources available on the physical
device that are used by the logical devices advertised through DRA.

Logical devices can specify the ConsumesCounters list. Each entry contains a reference to a CounterSet
and a set of named counters with the amounts they will consume. So for a device to be allocatable,
the referenced counter sets must have sufficient quantity for the counters referenced by the device.

Here is an example of two devices, each consuming 6Gi of memory from the a shared counter with
8Gi of memory. Thus, only one of the devices can be allocated at any point in time. The scheduler
handles this and it is transparent to the consumer as the ResourceClaim API is not affected.

```yaml
kind: ResourceSlice
apiVersion: resource.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: resourceslice
spec:
  nodeName: worker-1
  pool:
    name: pool
    generation: 1
    resourceSliceCount: 1
  driver: dra.example.com
  sharedCounters:
  - name: gpu-1-counters
    counters:
      memory:
        value: 8Gi
  devices:
  - name: device-1
    consumesCounters:
    - counterSet: gpu-1-counters
      counters:
        memory: 
          value: 6Gi
  - name: device-2
    consumesCounters:
    - counterSet: gpu-1-counters
      counters:
        memory: 
          value: 6Gi
```

## Enabling dynamic resource allocation

Dynamic resource allocation is a *beta feature* which is off by default and only enabled when the
`DynamicResourceAllocation` [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
and the `resource.k8s.io/v1beta1` {{< glossary_tooltip text="API group" term_id="api-group" >}}
are enabled. For details on that, see the `--feature-gates` and `--runtime-config`
[kube-apiserver parameters](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/).
kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and kubelet also need the feature gate.

When a resource driver reports the status of the devices, then the
`DRAResourceClaimDeviceStatus` feature gate has to be enabled in addition to
`DynamicResourceAllocation`.

A quick check whether a Kubernetes cluster supports the feature is to list
DeviceClass objects with:

```shell
kubectl get deviceclasses
```

If your cluster supports dynamic resource allocation, the response is either a
list of DeviceClass objects or:

```
No resources found
```

If not supported, this error is printed instead:

```
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "deviceclasses"
```

The default configuration of kube-scheduler enables the "DynamicResources"
plugin if and only if the feature gate is enabled and when using
the v1 configuration API. Custom configurations may have to be modified to
include it.

In addition to enabling the feature in the cluster, a resource driver also has to
be installed. Please refer to the driver's documentation for details.
