<!-- overview -->

You can constrain a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}} so that it is
_restricted_ to run on particular {{< glossary_tooltip text="node(s)" term_id="node" >}},
or to _prefer_ to run on particular nodes.
There are several ways to do this and the recommended approaches all use
[label selectors](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/) to facilitate the selection.
Often, you do not need to set any such constraints; the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="scheduler" term_id="kube-scheduler" >}} will automatically do a reasonable placement
(for example, spreading your Pods across nodes so as not place Pods on a node with insufficient free resources).
However, there are some circumstances where you may want to control which node
the Pod deploys to, for example, to ensure that a Pod ends up on a node with an SSD attached to it,
or to co-locate Pods from two different services that communicate a lot into the same availability zone.

<!-- body -->

You can use any of the following methods to choose where Kubernetes schedules
specific Pods:

- [nodeSelector](#nodeselector) field matching against [node labels](#built-in-node-labels)
- [Affinity and anti-affinity](#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
- [nodeName](#nodename) field
- [Pod topology spread constraints](#pod-topology-spread-constraints)

## Node labels {#built-in-node-labels}

Like many other Kubernetes objects, nodes have
[labels](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/). You can [attach labels manually](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/#add-a-label-to-a-node).
Kubernetes also populates a standard set of labels on all nodes in a cluster. See [Well-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/)
for a list of common node labels.

{{<note>}}
The value of these labels is cloud provider specific and is not guaranteed to be reliable.
For example, the value of `kubernetes.io/hostname` may be the same as the node name in some environments
and a different value in other environments.
{{</note>}}

### Node isolation/restriction

Adding labels to nodes allows you to target Pods for scheduling on specific
nodes or groups of nodes. You can use this functionality to ensure that specific
Pods only run on nodes with certain isolation, security, or regulatory
properties.

If you use labels for node isolation, choose label keys that the {{<glossary_tooltip text="kubelet" term_id="kubelet">}}
cannot modify. This prevents a compromised node from setting those labels on
itself so that the scheduler schedules workloads onto the compromised node.

The [`NodeRestriction` admission plugin](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction)
prevents the kubelet from setting or modifying labels with a
`node-restriction.kubernetes.io/` prefix.

To make use of that label prefix for node isolation:

1. Ensure you are using the [Node authorizer](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) and have _enabled_ the `NodeRestriction` admission plugin.
2. Add labels with the `node-restriction.kubernetes.io/` prefix to your nodes, and use those labels in your [node selectors](#nodeselector).
   For example, `example.com.node-restriction.kubernetes.io/fips=true` or `example.com.node-restriction.kubernetes.io/pci-dss=true`.

## nodeSelector

`nodeSelector` is the simplest recommended form of node selection constraint.
You can add the `nodeSelector` field to your Pod specification and specify the
[node labels](#built-in-node-labels) you want the target node to have.
Kubernetes only schedules the Pod onto nodes that have each of the labels you
specify.

See [Assign Pods to Nodes](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes) for more
information.

## Affinity and anti-affinity

`nodeSelector` is the simplest way to constrain Pods to nodes with specific
labels. Affinity and anti-affinity expands the types of constraints you can
define. Some of the benefits of affinity and anti-affinity include:

- The affinity/anti-affinity language is more expressive. `nodeSelector` only
  selects nodes with all the specified labels. Affinity/anti-affinity gives you
  more control over the selection logic.
- You can indicate that a rule is *soft* or *preferred*, so that the scheduler
  still schedules the Pod even if it can't find a matching node.
- You can constrain a Pod using labels on other Pods running on the node (or other topological domain),
  instead of just node labels, which allows you to define rules for which Pods
  can be co-located on a node.

The affinity feature consists of two types of affinity:

- *Node affinity* functions like the `nodeSelector` field but is more expressive and
  allows you to specify soft rules. 
- *Inter-pod affinity/anti-affinity* allows you to constrain Pods against labels
  on other Pods.

### Node affinity

Node affinity is conceptually similar to `nodeSelector`, allowing you to constrain which nodes your
Pod can be scheduled on based on node labels. There are two types of node
affinity:

- `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: The scheduler can't
  schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like `nodeSelector`,
  but with a more expressive syntax.
- `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`: The scheduler tries to
  find a node that meets the rule. If a matching node is not available, the
  scheduler still schedules the Pod.

{{<note>}}
In the preceding types, `IgnoredDuringExecution` means that if the node labels
change after Kubernetes schedules the Pod, the Pod continues to run.
{{</note>}}

You can specify node affinities using the `.spec.affinity.nodeAffinity` field in
your Pod spec.

For example, consider the following Pod spec:

{{< codenew file="pods/pod-with-node-affinity.yaml" >}}

In this example, the following rules apply:

- The node *must* have a label with the key `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` and
  the value of that label *must* be either `antarctica-east1` or `antarctica-west1`.
- The node *preferably* has a label with the key `another-node-label-key` and
  the value `another-node-label-value`.

You can use the `operator` field to specify a logical operator for Kubernetes to use when
interpreting the rules. You can use `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`,
`Gt` and `Lt`.

Read [Operators](#operators)
to learn more about how these work.

`NotIn` and `DoesNotExist` allow you to define node anti-affinity behavior.
Alternatively, you can use [node taints](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/)
to repel Pods from specific nodes.

{{<note>}}
If you specify both `nodeSelector` and `nodeAffinity`, *both* must be satisfied
for the Pod to be scheduled onto a node.

If you specify multiple terms in `nodeSelectorTerms` associated with `nodeAffinity`
types, then the Pod can be scheduled onto a node if one of the specified terms
can be satisfied (terms are ORed).

If you specify multiple expressions in a single `matchExpressions` field associated with a
term in `nodeSelectorTerms`, then the Pod can be scheduled onto a node only
if all the expressions are satisfied (expressions are ANDed).
{{</note>}}

See [Assign Pods to Nodes using Node Affinity](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/)
for more information.

#### Node affinity weight

You can specify a `weight` between 1 and 100 for each instance of the
`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` affinity type. When the
scheduler finds nodes that meet all the other scheduling requirements of the Pod, the
scheduler iterates through every preferred rule that the node satisfies and adds the
value of the `weight` for that expression to a sum.

The final sum is added to the score of other priority functions for the node.
Nodes with the highest total score are prioritized when the scheduler makes a
scheduling decision for the Pod.

For example, consider the following Pod spec:

{{< codenew file="pods/pod-with-affinity-anti-affinity.yaml" >}}

If there are two possible nodes that match the
`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` rule, one with the
`label-1:key-1` label and another with the `label-2:key-2` label, the scheduler
considers the `weight` of each node and adds the weight to the other scores for
that node, and schedules the Pod onto the node with the highest final score.

{{<note>}}
If you want Kubernetes to successfully schedule the Pods in this example, you
must have existing nodes with the `kubernetes.io/os=linux` label.
{{</note>}}

#### Node affinity per scheduling profile

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.20" state="beta" >}}

When configuring multiple [scheduling profiles](/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#multiple-profiles), you can associate
a profile with a node affinity, which is useful if a profile only applies to a specific set of nodes.
To do so, add an `addedAffinity` to the `args` field of the [`NodeAffinity` plugin](/docs/reference/scheduling/config/#scheduling-plugins)
in the [scheduler configuration](/docs/reference/scheduling/config/). For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubescheduler.config.k8s.io/v1beta3
kind: KubeSchedulerConfiguration

profiles:
  - schedulerName: default-scheduler
  - schedulerName: foo-scheduler
    pluginConfig:
      - name: NodeAffinity
        args:
          addedAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
              nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                - key: scheduler-profile
                  operator: In
                  values:
                  - foo
```

The `addedAffinity` is applied to all Pods that set `.spec.schedulerName` to `foo-scheduler`, in addition to the
NodeAffinity specified in the PodSpec.
That is, in order to match the Pod, nodes need to satisfy `addedAffinity` and
the Pod's `.spec.NodeAffinity`.

Since the `addedAffinity` is not visible to end users, its behavior might be
unexpected to them. Use node labels that have a clear correlation to the
scheduler profile name.

{{< note >}}
The DaemonSet controller, which [creates Pods for DaemonSets](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/#how-daemon-pods-are-scheduled),
does not support scheduling profiles. When the DaemonSet controller creates
Pods, the default Kubernetes scheduler places those Pods and honors any
`nodeAffinity` rules in the DaemonSet controller.
{{< /note >}}

### Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity allow you to constrain which nodes your
Pods can be scheduled on based on the labels of **Pods** already running on that
node, instead of the node labels.

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity rules take the form "this
Pod should (or, in the case of anti-affinity, should not) run in an X if that X
is already running one or more Pods that meet rule Y", where X is a topology
domain like node, rack, cloud provider zone or region, or similar and Y is the
rule Kubernetes tries to satisfy.

You express these rules (Y) as [label selectors](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors)
with an optional associated list of namespaces. Pods are namespaced objects in
Kubernetes, so Pod labels also implicitly have namespaces. Any label selectors
for Pod labels should specify the namespaces in which Kubernetes should look for those
labels.

You express the topology domain (X) using a `topologyKey`, which is the key for
the node label that the system uses to denote the domain. For examples, see
[Well-Known Labels, Annotations and Taints](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/).

{{< note >}}
Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity require substantial amount of
processing which can slow down scheduling in large clusters significantly. We do
not recommend using them in clusters larger than several hundred nodes.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
Pod anti-affinity requires nodes to be consistently labelled, in other words,
every node in the cluster must have an appropriate label matching `topologyKey`.
If some or all nodes are missing the specified `topologyKey` label, it can lead
to unintended behavior.
{{< /note >}}

#### Types of inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity

Similar to [node affinity](#node-affinity) are two types of Pod affinity and
anti-affinity as follows:

- `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
- `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

For example, you could use
`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` affinity to tell the scheduler to
co-locate Pods of two services in the same cloud provider zone because they
communicate with each other a lot. Similarly, you could use
`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` anti-affinity to spread Pods
from a service across multiple cloud provider zones.

To use inter-pod affinity, use the `affinity.podAffinity` field in the Pod spec.
For inter-pod anti-affinity, use the `affinity.podAntiAffinity` field in the Pod
spec.

#### Pod affinity example {#an-example-of-a-pod-that-uses-pod-affinity}

Consider the following Pod spec:

{{< codenew file="pods/pod-with-pod-affinity.yaml" >}}

This example defines one Pod affinity rule and one Pod anti-affinity rule. The
Pod affinity rule uses the "hard"
`requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`, while the anti-affinity rule
uses the "soft" `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`.

The affinity rule says that the scheduler can only schedule a Pod onto a node if
the node is in the same zone as one or more existing Pods with the label
`security=S1`. More precisely, the scheduler must place the Pod on a node that has the
`topology.kubernetes.io/zone=V` label, as long as there is at least one node in
that zone that currently has one or more Pods with the Pod label `security=S1`.

The anti-affinity rule says that the scheduler should try to avoid scheduling
the Pod onto a node that is in the same zone as one or more Pods with the label
`security=S2`. More precisely, the scheduler should try to avoid placing the Pod on a node that has the
`topology.kubernetes.io/zone=R` label if there are other nodes in the
same zone currently running Pods with the `Security=S2` Pod label.

To get yourself more familiar with the examples of Pod affinity and anti-affinity,
refer to the [design proposal](https://git.k8s.io/design-proposals-archive/scheduling/podaffinity.md).

You can use the `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists` and `DoesNotExist` values in the
`operator` field for Pod affinity and anti-affinity.

Read [Operators](#operators)
to learn more about how these work.

In principle, the `topologyKey` can be any allowed label key with the following
exceptions for performance and security reasons:

- For Pod affinity and anti-affinity, an empty `topologyKey` field is not allowed in both `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`
  and `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`.
- For `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` Pod anti-affinity rules,
  the admission controller `LimitPodHardAntiAffinityTopology` limits
  `topologyKey` to `kubernetes.io/hostname`. You can modify or disable the
  admission controller if you want to allow custom topologies.

In addition to `labelSelector` and `topologyKey`, you can optionally specify a list
of namespaces which the `labelSelector` should match against using the
`namespaces` field at the same level as `labelSelector` and `topologyKey`.
If omitted or empty, `namespaces` defaults to the namespace of the Pod where the
affinity/anti-affinity definition appears.

#### Namespace selector

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

You can also select matching namespaces using `namespaceSelector`, which is a label query over the set of namespaces.
The affinity term is applied to namespaces selected by both `namespaceSelector` and the `namespaces` field.
Note that an empty `namespaceSelector` ({}) matches all namespaces, while a null or empty `namespaces` list and
null `namespaceSelector` matches the namespace of the Pod where the rule is defined.

#### More practical use-cases

Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity can be even more useful when they are used with higher
level collections such as ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, Deployments, etc. These
rules allow you to configure that a set of workloads should
be co-located in the same defined topology; for example, preferring to place two related
Pods onto the same node.

For example: imagine a three-node cluster. You use the cluster to run a web application
and also an in-memory cache (such as Redis). For this example, also assume that latency between
the web application and the memory cache should be as low as is practical. You could use inter-pod
affinity and anti-affinity to co-locate the web servers with the cache as much as possible.

In the following example Deployment for the Redis cache, the replicas get the label `app=store`. The
`podAntiAffinity` rule tells the scheduler to avoid placing multiple replicas
with the `app=store` label on a single node. This creates each cache in a
separate node.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-cache
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: store
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: store
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      containers:
      - name: redis-server
        image: redis:3.2-alpine
```

The following example Deployment for the web servers creates replicas with the label `app=web-store`.
The Pod affinity rule tells the scheduler to place each replica on a node that has a Pod
with the label `app=store`. The Pod anti-affinity rule tells the scheduler never to place
multiple `app=web-store` servers on a single node.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-server
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-store
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-store
    spec:
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - web-store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
        podAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: app
                operator: In
                values:
                - store
            topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: nginx:1.16-alpine
```

Creating the two preceding Deployments results in the following cluster layout,
where each web server is co-located with a cache, on three separate nodes.

|    node-1     |    node-2     |    node-3     |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| *webserver-1* | *webserver-2* | *webserver-3* |
|   *cache-1*   |   *cache-2*   |   *cache-3*   |

The overall effect is that each cache instance is likely to be accessed by a single client, that
is running on the same node. This approach aims to minimize both skew (imbalanced load) and latency.

You might have other reasons to use Pod anti-affinity.
See the [ZooKeeper tutorial](/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/zookeeper/#tolerating-node-failure)
for an example of a StatefulSet configured with anti-affinity for high
availability, using the same technique as this example.

## nodeName

`nodeName` is a more direct form of node selection than affinity or
`nodeSelector`. `nodeName` is a field in the Pod spec. If the `nodeName` field
is not empty, the scheduler ignores the Pod and the kubelet on the named node
tries to place the Pod on that node. Using `nodeName` overrules using
`nodeSelector` or affinity and anti-affinity rules.

Some of the limitations of using `nodeName` to select nodes are:

- If the named node does not exist, the Pod will not run, and in
  some cases may be automatically deleted.
- If the named node does not have the resources to accommodate the
  Pod, the Pod will fail and its reason will indicate why,
  for example OutOfmemory or OutOfcpu.
- Node names in cloud environments are not always predictable or stable.

{{< note >}}
`nodeName` is intended for use by custom schedulers or advanced use cases where
you need to bypass any configured schedulers. Bypassing the schedulers might lead to
failed Pods if the assigned Nodes get oversubscribed. You can use [node affinity](#node-affinity) or a the [`nodeselector` field](#nodeselector) to assign a Pod to a specific Node without bypassing the schedulers.
{{</ note >}}

Here is an example of a Pod spec using the `nodeName` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeName: kube-01
```

The above Pod will only run on the node `kube-01`.

## Pod topology spread constraints

You can use _topology spread constraints_ to control how {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="Pod" >}}
are spread across your cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, or among any other
topology domains that you define. You might do this to improve performance, expected availability, or
overall utilization.

Read [Pod topology spread constraints](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/)
to learn more about how these work.

## Operators

The following are all the logical operators that you can use in the `operator` field for `nodeAffinity` and `podAffinity` mentioned above.

|    Operator    |    Behavior     |
| :------------: | :-------------: |
| `In` | The label value is present in the supplied set of strings |
|   `NotIn`   | The label value is not contained in the supplied set of strings |
| `Exists` | A label with this key exists on the object |
| `DoesNotExist` | No label with this key exists on the object |

The following operators can only be used with `nodeAffinity`.

|    Operator    |    Behaviour    |
| :------------: | :-------------: |
| `Gt` | The supplied value will be parsed as an integer, and that integer is less than or equal to the integer that results from parsing the value of a label named by this selector | 
| `Lt` | The supplied value will be parsed as an integer, and that integer is greater than or equal to the integer that results from parsing the value of a label named by this selector | 


{{<note>}}
`Gt` and `Lt` operators will not work with non-integer values. If the given value 
doesn't parse as an integer, the pod will fail to get scheduled. Also, `Gt` and `Lt` 
are not available for `podAffinity`.
