## The Kubernetes network model

Every [`Pod`](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) in a cluster gets its own unique cluster-wide IP address. 
This means you do not need to explicitly create links between `Pods` and you 
almost never need to deal with mapping container ports to host ports.  
This creates a clean, backwards-compatible model where `Pods` can be treated 
much like VMs or physical hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, 
naming, service discovery, [load balancing](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#load-balancing), 
application configuration, and migration.

Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking
implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):

   * pods can communicate with all other pods on any other [node](/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) 
     without NAT
   * agents on a node (e.g. system daemons, kubelet) can communicate with all
     pods on that node

Note: For those platforms that support `Pods` running in the host network (e.g.
Linux), when pods are attached to the host network of a node they can still communicate 
with all pods on all nodes without NAT.

This model is not only less complex overall, but it is principally compatible
with the desire for Kubernetes to enable low-friction porting of apps from VMs
to containers.  If your job previously ran in a VM, your VM had an IP and could
talk to other VMs in your project.  This is the same basic model.

Kubernetes IP addresses exist at the `Pod` scope - containers within a `Pod`
share their network namespaces - including their IP address and MAC address.
This means that containers within a `Pod` can all reach each other's ports on
`localhost`. This also means that containers within a `Pod` must coordinate port
usage, but this is no different from processes in a VM.  This is called the
"IP-per-pod" model.

How this is implemented is a detail of the particular container runtime in use.

It is possible to request ports on the `Node` itself which forward to your `Pod`
(called host ports), but this is a very niche operation. How that forwarding is
implemented is also a detail of the container runtime. The `Pod` itself is
blind to the existence or non-existence of host ports.

Kubernetes networking addresses four concerns:
- Containers within a Pod [use networking to communicate](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/) via loopback.
- Cluster networking provides communication between different Pods.
- The [Service](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) API lets you
  [expose an application running in Pods](/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/)
  to be reachable from outside your cluster.
  - [Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) provides extra functionality
    specifically for exposing HTTP applications, websites and APIs.
- You can also use Services to
  [publish services only for consumption inside your cluster](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service-traffic-policy/).

The [Connecting Applications with Services](/docs/tutorials/services/connect-applications-service/) tutorial lets you learn about Services and Kubernetes networking with a hands-on example.

[Cluster Networking](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/) explains how to set
up networking for your cluster, and also provides an overview of the technologies involved.
