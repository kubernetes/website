In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running. 

Unlike other types of controllers which run as part of the `kube-controller-manager` binary, Ingress controllers 
are not started automatically with a cluster. Use this page to choose the ingress controller implementation 
that best fits your cluster.

Kubernetes as a project currently supports and maintains [GCE](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-gce/README.md) and
  [nginx](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/README.md) controllers.

## Using multiple Ingress controllers

You may deploy [any number of ingress controllers](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/docs/user-guide/multiple-ingress.md#multiple-ingress-controllers) 
within a cluster. When you create an ingress, you should annotate each ingress with the appropriate
[`ingress.class`](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-gce/docs/faq/README.md#how-do-i-run-multiple-ingress-controllers-in-the-same-cluster) 
to indicate which ingress controller should be used if more than one exists within your cluster.

If you do not define a class, your cloud provider may use a default ingress controller.

Ideally, all ingress controllers should fulfill this specification, but the various ingress
controllers operate slightly differently.

{{< note >}}
Make sure you review your ingress controller's documentation to understand the caveats of choosing it.
