description: >-
  In order for an [Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to work in your cluster,
  there must be an _ingress controller_ running.
  You need to select at least one ingress controller and make sure it is set up in your cluster.  
  This page lists common ingress controllers that you can deploy.

<!-- overview -->

In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running. 

Unlike other types of controllers which run as part of the `kube-controller-manager` binary, Ingress controllers 
are not started automatically with a cluster. Use this page to choose the ingress controller implementation 
that best fits your cluster.

Kubernetes as a project supports and maintains [AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller#readme), [GCE](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-gce/README.md#readme), and
  [nginx](https://git.k8s.io/ingress-nginx/README.md#readme) ingress controllers.

## Using multiple Ingress controllers

You may deploy any number of ingress controllers using [ingress class](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#ingress-class)
within a cluster. Note the `.metadata.name` of your ingress class resource. When you create an ingress you would need that name to specify the `ingressClassName` field on your Ingress object (refer to [IngressSpec v1 reference](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/ingress-v1/#IngressSpec)). `ingressClassName` is a replacement of the older [annotation method](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#deprecated-annotation).

If you do not specify an IngressClass for an Ingress, and your cluster has exactly one IngressClass marked as default, then Kubernetes [applies](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#default-ingress-class) the cluster's default IngressClass to the Ingress.
You mark an IngressClass as default by setting the [`ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#ingressclass-kubernetes-io-is-default-class) on that IngressClass, with the string value `"true"`.

Ideally, all ingress controllers should fulfill this specification, but the various ingress
controllers operate slightly differently.

{{< note >}}
Make sure you review your ingress controller's documentation to understand the caveats of choosing it.
