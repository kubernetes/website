<!-- overview -->

{{< glossary_definition term_id="service" length="short" prepend="In Kubernetes, a Service is" >}}

A key aim of Services in Kubernetes is that you don't need to modify your existing
application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism.
You can run code in Pods, whether this is a code designed for a cloud-native world, or
an older app you've containerized. You use a Service to make that set of Pods available
on the network so that clients can interact with it.

If you use a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="deployment" >}} to run your app,
that Deployment can create and destroy Pods dynamically. From one moment to the next,
you don't know how many of those Pods are working and healthy; you might not even know
what those healthy Pods are named.
Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pod" text="Pods" >}} are created and destroyed
to match the desired state of your cluster. Pods are ephemeral resources (you should not
expect that an individual Pod is reliable and durable).

Each Pod gets its own IP address (Kubernetes expects network plugins to ensure this).
For a given Deployment in your cluster, the set of Pods running in one moment in
time could be different from the set of Pods running that application a moment later.

This leads to a problem: if some set of Pods (call them "backends") provides
functionality to other Pods (call them "frontends") inside your cluster,
how do the frontends find out and keep track of which IP address to connect
to, so that the frontend can use the backend part of the workload?

Enter _Services_.

## Services in Kubernetes

The Service API, part of Kubernetes, is an abstraction to help you expose groups of
Pods over a network. Each Service object defines a logical set of endpoints (usually
these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy about how to make those pods accessible.

For example, consider a stateless image-processing backend which is running with
3 replicas.  Those replicas are fungible&mdash;frontends do not care which backend
they use.  While the actual Pods that compose the backend set may change, the
frontend clients should not need to be aware of that, nor should they need to keep
track of the set of backends themselves.

The Service abstraction enables this decoupling.

The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined
by a {{< glossary_tooltip text="selector" term_id="selector" >}} that you
define.
To learn about other ways to define Service endpoints,
see [Services _without_ selectors](#services-without-selectors).

If your workload speaks HTTP, you might choose to use an
[Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to control how web traffic
reaches that workload.
Ingress is not a Service type, but it acts as the entry point for your
cluster. An Ingress lets you consolidate your routing rules into a single resource, so
that you can expose multiple components of your workload, running separately in your
cluster, behind a single listener.

The [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/#what-is-the-gateway-api) API for Kubernetes
provides extra capabilities beyond Ingress and Service. You can add Gateway to your cluster -
it is a family of extension APIs, implemented using
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="CustomResourceDefinition" text="CustomResourceDefinitions" >}} -
and then use these to configure access to network services that are running in your cluster.

### Cloud-native service discovery

If you're able to use Kubernetes APIs for service discovery in your application,
you can query the {{< glossary_tooltip text="API server" term_id="kube-apiserver" >}}
for matching EndpointSlices. Kubernetes updates the EndpointSlices for a Service
whenever the set of Pods in a Service changes.

For non-native applications, Kubernetes offers ways to place a network port or load
balancer in between your application and the backend Pods.

Either way, your workload can use these [service discovery](#discovering-services)
mechanisms to find the target it wants to connect to.

## Defining a Service

A Service is an {{< glossary_tooltip text="object" term_id="object" >}}
(the same way that a Pod or a ConfigMap is an object). You can create,
view or modify Service definitions using the Kubernetes API. Usually
you use a tool such as `kubectl` to make those API calls for you.

For example, suppose you have a set of Pods that each listen on TCP port 9376
and are labelled as `app.kubernetes.io/name=MyApp`. You can define a Service to
publish that TCP listener:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

Applying this manifest creates a new Service named "my-service", which
targets TCP port 9376 on any Pod with the `app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp` label.

Kubernetes assigns this Service an IP address (the _cluster IP_),
that is used by the virtual IP address mechanism. For more details on that mechanism,
read [Virtual IPs and Service Proxies](/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/).

The controller for that Service continuously scans for Pods that
match its selector, and then makes any necessary updates to the set of
EndpointSlices for the Service.

The name of a Service object must be a valid
[RFC 1035 label name](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#rfc-1035-label-names).


{{< note >}}
A Service can map _any_ incoming `port` to a `targetPort`. By default and
for convenience, the `targetPort` is set to the same value as the `port`
field.
{{< /note >}}

### Port definitions {#field-spec-ports}

Port definitions in Pods have names, and you can reference these names in the
`targetPort` attribute of a Service. For example, we can bind the `targetPort`
of the Service to the Pod port in the following way:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:stable
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
        name: http-web-svc

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy
  ports:
  - name: name-of-service-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: http-web-svc
```


This works even if there is a mixture of Pods in the Service using a single
configured name, with the same network protocol available via different
port numbers. This offers a lot of flexibility for deploying and evolving
your Services. For example, you can change the port numbers that Pods expose
in the next version of your backend software, without breaking clients.

The default protocol for Services is
[TCP](/docs/reference/networking/service-protocols/#protocol-tcp); you can also
use any other [supported protocol](/docs/reference/networking/service-protocols/).

Because many Services need to expose more than one port, Kubernetes supports
[multiple port definitions](#multi-port-services) for a single Service.
Each port definition can have the same `protocol`, or a different one.

### Services without selectors

Services most commonly abstract access to Kubernetes Pods thanks to the selector,
but when used with a corresponding set of
{{<glossary_tooltip term_id="endpoint-slice" text="EndpointSlices">}}
objects and without a selector, the Service can abstract other kinds of backends,
including ones that run outside the cluster.

For example:

* You want to have an external database cluster in production, but in your
  test environment you use your own databases.
* You want to point your Service to a Service in a different
  {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="namespace" >}} or on another cluster.
* You are migrating a workload to Kubernetes. While evaluating the approach,
  you run only a portion of your backends in Kubernetes.

In any of these scenarios you can define a Service _without_ specifying a
selector to match Pods. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

Because this Service has no selector, the corresponding EndpointSlice (and
legacy Endpoints) objects are not created automatically. You can map the Service
to the network address and port where it's running, by adding an EndpointSlice
object manually. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: discovery.k8s.io/v1
kind: EndpointSlice
metadata:
  name: my-service-1 # by convention, use the name of the Service
                     # as a prefix for the name of the EndpointSlice
  labels:
    # You should set the "kubernetes.io/service-name" label.
    # Set its value to match the name of the Service
    kubernetes.io/service-name: my-service
addressType: IPv4
ports:
  - name: '' # empty because port 9376 is not assigned as a well-known
             # port (by IANA)
    appProtocol: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 9376
endpoints:
  - addresses:
      - "10.4.5.6" # the IP addresses in this list can appear in any order
      - "10.1.2.3"
```

#### Custom EndpointSlices

When you create an [EndpointSlice](#endpointslices) object for a Service, you can
use any name for the EndpointSlice. Each EndpointSlice in a namespace must have a
unique name. You link an EndpointSlice to a Service by setting the
`kubernetes.io/service-name` {{< glossary_tooltip text="label" term_id="label" >}}
on that EndpointSlice.

{{< note >}}
The endpoint IPs _must not_ be: loopback (127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, ::1/128 for IPv6), or
link-local (169.254.0.0/16 and 224.0.0.0/24 for IPv4, fe80::/64 for IPv6).

The endpoint IP addresses cannot be the cluster IPs of other Kubernetes Services,
because {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="kube-proxy" >}} doesn't support virtual IPs
as a destination.
{{< /note >}}

For an EndpointSlice that you create yourself, or in your own code,
you should also pick a value to use for the [`endpointslice.kubernetes.io/managed-by`](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#endpointslicekubernetesiomanaged-by) label.
If you create your own controller code to manage EndpointSlices, consider using a
value similar to `"my-domain.example/name-of-controller"`. If you are using a third
party tool, use the name of the tool in all-lowercase and change spaces and other
punctuation to dashes (`-`).
If people are directly using a tool such as `kubectl` to manage EndpointSlices,
use a name that describes this manual management, such as `"staff"` or
`"cluster-admins"`. You should
avoid using the reserved value `"controller"`, which identifies EndpointSlices
managed by Kubernetes' own control plane.

#### Accessing a Service without a selector {#service-no-selector-access}

Accessing a Service without a selector works the same as if it had a selector.
In the [example](#services-without-selectors) for a Service without a selector, traffic is routed to one of the two endpoints defined in
the EndpointSlice manifest: a TCP connection to 10.1.2.3 or 10.4.5.6, on port 9376.

{{< note >}}
The Kubernetes API server does not allow proxying to endpoints that are not mapped to
pods. Actions such as `kubectl proxy <service-name>` where the service has no
selector will fail due to this constraint. This prevents the Kubernetes API server
from being used as a proxy to endpoints the caller may not be authorized to access.
{{< /note >}}

An `ExternalName` Service is a special case of Service that does not have
selectors and uses DNS names instead. For more information, see the
[ExternalName](#externalname) section.

### EndpointSlices

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.21" state="stable" >}}

[EndpointSlices](/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/) are objects that
represent a subset (a _slice_) of the backing network endpoints for a Service.

Your Kubernetes cluster tracks how many endpoints each EndpointSlice represents.
If there are so many endpoints for a Service that a threshold is reached, then
Kubernetes adds another empty EndpointSlice and stores new endpoint information
there.
By default, Kubernetes makes a new EndpointSlice once the existing EndpointSlices
all contain at least 100 endpoints. Kubernetes does not make the new EndpointSlice
until an extra endpoint needs to be added.

See [EndpointSlices](/docs/concepts/services-networking/endpoint-slices/) for more
information about this API.

### Endpoints

In the Kubernetes API, an
[Endpoints](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/endpoints-v1/)
(the resource kind is plural) defines a list of network endpoints, typically
referenced by a Service to define which Pods the traffic can be sent to.

The EndpointSlice API is the recommended replacement for Endpoints.

#### Over-capacity endpoints

Kubernetes limits the number of endpoints that can fit in a single Endpoints
object. When there are over 1000 backing endpoints for a Service, Kubernetes
truncates the data in the Endpoints object. Because a Service can be linked
with more than one EndpointSlice, the 1000 backing endpoint limit only
affects the legacy Endpoints API.

In that case, Kubernetes selects at most 1000 possible backend endpoints to store
into the Endpoints object, and sets an
{{< glossary_tooltip text="annotation" term_id="annotation" >}} on the
Endpoints:
[`endpoints.kubernetes.io/over-capacity: truncated`](/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#endpoints-kubernetes-io-over-capacity).
The control plane also removes that annotation if the number of backend Pods drops below 1000.

Traffic is still sent to backends, but any load balancing mechanism that relies on the
legacy Endpoints API only sends traffic to at most 1000 of the available backing endpoints.

The same API limit means that you cannot manually update an Endpoints to have more than 1000 endpoints.

### Application protocol

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.20" state="stable" >}}

The `appProtocol` field provides a way to specify an application protocol for
each Service port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand.
The value of this field is mirrored by the corresponding
Endpoints and EndpointSlice objects.

This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are one of:

* [IANA standard service names](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names).

* Implementation-defined prefixed names such as `mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol`.

* Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `kubernetes.io/h2c` | HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in [RFC 7540](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540) |



### Multi-port Services

For some Services, you need to expose more than one port.
Kubernetes lets you configure multiple port definitions on a Service object.
When using multiple ports for a Service, you must give all of your ports names
so that these are unambiguous.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
    - name: https
      protocol: TCP
      port: 443
      targetPort: 9377
```

{{< note >}}
As with Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="name" text="names">}} in general, names for ports
must only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and `-`. Port names must
also start and end with an alphanumeric character.

For example, the names `123-abc` and `web` are valid, but `123_abc` and `-web` are not.
{{< /note >}}


## Service type  {#publishing-services-service-types}

For some parts of your application (for example, frontends) you may want to expose a
Service onto an external IP address, one that's accessible from outside of your
cluster.

Kubernetes Service types allow you to specify what kind of Service you want.

The available `type` values and their behaviors are:

[`ClusterIP`](#type-clusterip)
: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value
  makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster. This is the
  default that is used if you don't explicitly specify a `type` for a Service.
  You can expose the Service to the public internet using an [Ingress](/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) or a
  [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

[`NodePort`](#type-nodeport)
: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the `NodePort`).
  To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address,
  the same as if you had requested a Service of `type: ClusterIP`.

[`LoadBalancer`](#loadbalancer)
: Exposes the Service externally using an external load balancer. Kubernetes
  does not directly offer a load balancing component; you must provide one, or
  you can integrate your Kubernetes cluster with a cloud provider.

[`ExternalName`](#externalname)
: Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (for example,
  to the hostname `api.foo.bar.example`). The mapping configures your cluster's
  DNS server to return a `CNAME` record with that external hostname value.
  No proxying of any kind is set up.

The `type` field in the Service API is designed as nested functionality - each level
adds to the previous.  This is not strictly required on all cloud providers, but
the Kubernetes API design for Service requires it anyway.

### `type: ClusterIP` {#type-clusterip}

This default Service type assigns an IP address from a pool of IP addresses that
your cluster has reserved for that purpose.

Several of the other types for Service build on the `ClusterIP` type as a
foundation.

If you define a Service that has the `.spec.clusterIP` set to `"None"` then
Kubernetes does not assign an IP address. See [headless Services](#headless-services)
for more information.

#### Choosing your own IP address

You can specify your own cluster IP address as part of a `Service` creation
request.  To do this, set the `.spec.clusterIP` field. For example, if you
already have an existing DNS entry that you wish to reuse, or legacy systems
that are configured for a specific IP address and difficult to re-configure.

The IP address that you choose must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address from within the
`service-cluster-ip-range` CIDR range that is configured for the API server.
If you try to create a Service with an invalid `clusterIP` address value, the API
server will return a 422 HTTP status code to indicate that there's a problem.

Read [avoiding collisions](/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#avoiding-collisions)
to learn how Kubernetes helps reduce the risk and impact of two different Services
both trying to use the same IP address.

### `type: NodePort` {#type-nodeport}

If you set the `type` field to `NodePort`, the Kubernetes control plane
allocates a port from a range specified by `--service-node-port-range` flag (default: 30000-32767).
Each node proxies that port (the same port number on every Node) into your Service.
Your Service reports the allocated port in its `.spec.ports[*].nodePort` field.

Using a NodePort gives you the freedom to set up your own load balancing solution,
to configure environments that are not fully supported by Kubernetes, or even
to expose one or more nodes' IP addresses directly.

For a node port Service, Kubernetes additionally allocates a port (TCP, UDP or
SCTP to match the protocol of the Service). Every node in the cluster configures
itself to listen on that assigned port and to forward traffic to one of the ready
endpoints associated with that Service. You'll be able to contact the `type: NodePort`
Service, from outside the cluster, by connecting to any node using the appropriate
protocol (for example: TCP), and the appropriate port (as assigned to that Service).

#### Choosing your own port {#nodeport-custom-port}

If you want a specific port number, you can specify a value in the `nodePort`
field. The control plane will either allocate you that port or report that
the API transaction failed.
This means that you need to take care of possible port collisions yourself.
You also have to use a valid port number, one that's inside the range configured
for NodePort use.

Here is an example manifest for a Service of `type: NodePort` that specifies
a NodePort value (30007, in this example):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
      # By default and for convenience, the `targetPort` is set to the same value as the `port` field.
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      # Optional field
      # By default and for convenience, the Kubernetes control plane will allocate a port from a range (default: 30000-32767)
      nodePort: 30007
```

#### Reserve Nodeport Ranges to avoid collisions when port assigning 

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.27" state="alpha" >}}

The policy for assigning ports to NodePort services applies to both the auto-assignment and
the manual assignment scenarios. When a user wants to create a NodePort service that
uses a specific port, the target port may conflict with another port that has already been assigned.
In this case, you can enable the feature gate `ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange`, which allows you
to use a different port allocation strategy for NodePort Services. The port range for NodePort services
is divided into two bands. Dynamic port assignment uses the upper band by default, and it may use
the lower band once the upper band has been exhausted. Users can then allocate from the lower band
with a lower risk of port collision.


#### Custom IP address configuration for `type: NodePort` Services {#service-nodeport-custom-listen-address}

You can set up nodes in your cluster to use a particular IP address for serving node port
services. You might want to do this if each node is connected to multiple networks (for example:
one network for application traffic, and another network for traffic between nodes and the
control plane).

If you want to specify particular IP address(es) to proxy the port, you can set the
`--nodeport-addresses` flag for kube-proxy or the equivalent `nodePortAddresses`
field of the
[kube-proxy configuration file](/docs/reference/config-api/kube-proxy-config.v1alpha1/)
to particular IP block(s).

This flag takes a comma-delimited list of IP blocks (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`, `192.0.2.0/25`)
to specify IP address ranges that kube-proxy should consider as local to this node.

For example, if you start kube-proxy with the `--nodeport-addresses=127.0.0.0/8` flag,
kube-proxy only selects the loopback interface for NodePort Services.
The default for `--nodeport-addresses` is an empty list.
This means that kube-proxy should consider all available network interfaces for NodePort.
(That's also compatible with earlier Kubernetes releases.)
{{< note >}}
This Service is visible as `<NodeIP>:spec.ports[*].nodePort` and `.spec.clusterIP:spec.ports[*].port`.
If the `--nodeport-addresses` flag for kube-proxy or the equivalent field
in the kube-proxy configuration file is set, `<NodeIP>` would be a filtered node IP address (or possibly IP addresses).
{{< /note >}}

### `type: LoadBalancer` {#loadbalancer}

On cloud providers which support external load balancers, setting the `type`
field to `LoadBalancer` provisions a load balancer for your Service.
The actual creation of the load balancer happens asynchronously, and
information about the provisioned balancer is published in the Service's
`.status.loadBalancer` field.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
  clusterIP: 10.0.171.239
  type: LoadBalancer
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - ip: 192.0.2.127
```

Traffic from the external load balancer is directed at the backend Pods. The cloud
provider decides how it is load balanced.

To implement a Service of `type: LoadBalancer`, Kubernetes typically starts off
by making the changes that are equivalent to you requesting a Service of
`type: NodePort`. The cloud-controller-manager component then configures the external
load balancer to forward traffic to that assigned node port.

You can configure a load balanced Service to
[omit](#load-balancer-nodeport-allocation) assigning a node port, provided that the
cloud provider implementation supports this.

Some cloud providers allow you to specify the `loadBalancerIP`. In those cases, the load-balancer is created
with the user-specified `loadBalancerIP`. If the `loadBalancerIP` field is not specified,
the load balancer is set up with an ephemeral IP address. If you specify a `loadBalancerIP`
but your cloud provider does not support the feature, the `loadbalancerIP` field that you
set is ignored.


{{< note >}}
The`.spec.loadBalancerIP` field for a Service was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.24.

This field was under-specified and its meaning varies across implementations. It also cannot support dual-stack networking. This field may be removed in a future API version.

If you're integrating with a provider that supports specifying the load balancer IP address(es)
for a Service via a (provider specific) annotation, you should switch to doing that.

If you are writing code for a load balancer integration with Kubernetes, avoid using this field.
You can integrate with [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) rather than Service, or you
can define your own (provider specific) annotations on the Service that specify the equivalent detail.
{{< /note >}}

#### Load balancers with mixed protocol types

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="stable" >}}

By default, for LoadBalancer type of Services, when there is more than one port defined, all
ports must have the same protocol, and the protocol must be one which is supported
by the cloud provider.

The feature gate `MixedProtocolLBService` (enabled by default for the kube-apiserver as of v1.24) allows the use of
different protocols for LoadBalancer type of Services, when there is more than one port defined.

{{< note >}}
The set of protocols that can be used for load balanced Services is defined by your
cloud provider; they may impose restrictions beyond what the Kubernetes API enforces.
{{< /note >}}

#### Disabling load balancer NodePort allocation {#load-balancer-nodeport-allocation}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

You can optionally disable node port allocation for a Service of `type: LoadBalancer`, by setting
the field `spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts` to `false`. This should only be used for load balancer implementations
that route traffic directly to pods as opposed to using node ports. By default, `spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts`
is `true` and type LoadBalancer Services will continue to allocate node ports. If `spec.allocateLoadBalancerNodePorts`
is set to `false` on an existing Service with allocated node ports, those node ports will **not** be de-allocated automatically.
You must explicitly remove the `nodePorts` entry in every Service port to de-allocate those node ports.

#### Specifying class of load balancer implementation {#load-balancer-class}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

For a Service with `type` set to `LoadBalancer`, the `.spec.loadBalancerClass` field
enables you to use a load balancer implementation other than the cloud provider default.

By default, `.spec.loadBalancerClass` is not set and a `LoadBalancer`
type of Service uses the cloud provider's default load balancer implementation if the
cluster is configured with a cloud provider using the `--cloud-provider` component
flag.

If you specify `.spec.loadBalancerClass`, it is assumed that a load balancer
implementation that matches the specified class is watching for Services.
Any default load balancer implementation (for example, the one provided by
the cloud provider) will ignore Services that have this field set.
`spec.loadBalancerClass` can be set on a Service of type `LoadBalancer` only.
Once set, it cannot be changed.
The value of `spec.loadBalancerClass` must be a label-style identifier,
with an optional prefix such as "`internal-vip`" or "`example.com/internal-vip`".
Unprefixed names are reserved for end-users.

#### Internal load balancer

In a mixed environment it is sometimes necessary to route traffic from Services inside the same
(virtual) network address block.

In a split-horizon DNS environment you would need two Services to be able to route both external
and internal traffic to your endpoints.

To set an internal load balancer, add one of the following annotations to your Service
depending on the cloud service provider you're using:

{{< tabs name="service_tabs" >}}
{{% tab name="Default" %}}
Select one of the tabs.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="GCP" %}}

```yaml
[...]
metadata:
    name: my-service
    annotations:
        networking.gke.io/load-balancer-type: "Internal"
[...]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="AWS" %}}

```yaml
[...]
metadata:
    name: my-service
    annotations:
        service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "true"
[...]
```

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Azure" %}}

```yaml
[...]
metadata:

### `type: ExternalName` {#externalname}



Services of type ExternalName map a Service to a DNS name, not to a typical selector such as
`my-service` or `cassandra`. You specify these Services with the `spec.externalName` parameter.

This Service definition, for example, maps
the `my-service` Service in the `prod` namespace to `my.database.example.com`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: prod
spec:
  type: ExternalName
  externalName: my.database.example.com
```

{{< note >}}
A Service of `type: ExternalName` accepts an IPv4 address string, but treats that string as a DNS name comprised of digits,
not as an IP address (the internet does not however allow such names in DNS). Services with external names that resemble IPv4
addresses are not resolved by DNS servers.

If you want to map a Service directly to a specific IP address, consider using [headless Services](#headless-services).
{{< /note >}}

When looking up the host `my-service.prod.svc.cluster.local`, the cluster DNS Service
returns a `CNAME` record with the value `my.database.example.com`. Accessing
`my-service` works in the same way as other Services but with the crucial
difference that redirection happens at the DNS level rather than via proxying or
forwarding. Should you later decide to move your database into your cluster, you
can start its Pods, add appropriate selectors or endpoints, and change the
Service's `type`.

{{< caution >}}
You may have trouble using ExternalName for some common protocols, including HTTP and HTTPS.
If you use ExternalName then the hostname used by clients inside your cluster is different from
the name that the ExternalName references.

For protocols that use hostnames this difference may lead to errors or unexpected responses.
HTTP requests will have a `Host:` header that the origin server does not recognize;
TLS servers will not be able to provide a certificate matching the hostname that the client connected to.
{{< /caution >}}

## Headless Services

Sometimes you don't need load-balancing and a single Service IP.  In
this case, you can create what are termed _headless Services_, by explicitly
specifying `"None"` for the cluster IP address (`.spec.clusterIP`).

You can use a headless Service to interface with other service discovery mechanisms,
without being tied to Kubernetes' implementation.

For headless Services, a cluster IP is not allocated, kube-proxy does not handle
these Services, and there is no load balancing or proxying done by the platform
for them. How DNS is automatically configured depends on whether the Service has
selectors defined:

### With selectors

For headless Services that define selectors, the endpoints controller creates
EndpointSlices in the Kubernetes API, and modifies the DNS configuration to return
A or AAAA records (IPv4 or IPv6 addresses) that point directly to the Pods backing the Service.

### Without selectors

For headless Services that do not define selectors, the control plane does
not create EndpointSlice objects. However, the DNS system looks for and configures
either:

* DNS CNAME records for [`type: ExternalName`](#externalname) Services.
* DNS A / AAAA records for all IP addresses of the Service's ready endpoints,
  for all Service types other than `ExternalName`.
  * For IPv4 endpoints, the DNS system creates A records.
  * For IPv6 endpoints, the DNS system creates AAAA records.

When you define a headless Service without a selector, the `port` must
match the `targetPort`.

## Discovering services

For clients running inside your cluster, Kubernetes supports two primary modes of
finding a Service: environment variables and DNS.

### Environment variables

When a Pod is run on a Node, the kubelet adds a set of environment variables
for each active Service. It adds `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT` variables,
where the Service name is upper-cased and dashes are converted to underscores.
It also supports variables (see [makeLinkVariables](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dd2d12f6dc0e654c15d5db57a5f9f6ba61192726/pkg/kubelet/envvars/envvars.go#L72))
that are compatible with Docker Engine's
"_[legacy container links](https://docs.docker.com/network/links/)_" feature.

For example, the Service `redis-primary` which exposes TCP port 6379 and has been
allocated cluster IP address 10.0.0.11, produces the following environment
variables:

```shell
REDIS_PRIMARY_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.11
REDIS_PRIMARY_SERVICE_PORT=6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT=tcp://10.0.0.11:6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP=tcp://10.0.0.11:6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_PROTO=tcp
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_PORT=6379
REDIS_PRIMARY_PORT_6379_TCP_ADDR=10.0.0.11
```

{{< note >}}
When you have a Pod that needs to access a Service, and you are using
the environment variable method to publish the port and cluster IP to the client
Pods, you must create the Service *before* the client Pods come into existence.
Otherwise, those client Pods won't have their environment variables populated.

If you only use DNS to discover the cluster IP for a Service, you don't need to
worry about this ordering issue.
{{< /note >}}

Kubernetes also supports and provides variables that are compatible with Docker
Engine's "_[legacy container links](https://docs.docker.com/network/links/)_" feature.
You can read [`makeLinkVariables`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/dd2d12f6dc0e654c15d5db57a5f9f6ba61192726/pkg/kubelet/envvars/envvars.go#L72)
to see how this is implemented in Kubernetes.

### DNS

You can (and almost always should) set up a DNS service for your Kubernetes
cluster using an [add-on](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/).

A cluster-aware DNS server, such as CoreDNS, watches the Kubernetes API for new
Services and creates a set of DNS records for each one.  If DNS has been enabled
throughout your cluster then all Pods should automatically be able to resolve
Services by their DNS name.

For example, if you have a Service called `my-service` in a Kubernetes
namespace `my-ns`, the control plane and the DNS Service acting together
create a DNS record for `my-service.my-ns`. Pods in the `my-ns` namespace
should be able to find the service by doing a name lookup for `my-service`
(`my-service.my-ns` would also work).

Pods in other namespaces must qualify the name as `my-service.my-ns`. These names
will resolve to the cluster IP assigned for the Service.

Kubernetes also supports DNS SRV (Service) records for named ports.  If the
`my-service.my-ns` Service has a port named `http` with the protocol set to
`TCP`, you can do a DNS SRV query for `_http._tcp.my-service.my-ns` to discover
the port number for `http`, as well as the IP address.

The Kubernetes DNS server is the only way to access `ExternalName` Services.
You can find more information about `ExternalName` resolution in
[DNS for Services and Pods](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/).

## Virtual IP addressing mechanism

Read [Virtual IPs and Service Proxies](/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/) explains the
mechanism Kubernetes provides to expose a Service with a virtual IP address.

### Traffic policies

You can set the `.spec.internalTrafficPolicy` and `.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` fields
to control how Kubernetes routes traffic to healthy (“ready”) backends.

See [Traffic Policies](/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#traffic-policies) for more details.

### Session stickiness

If you want to make sure that connections from a particular client are passed to
the same Pod each time, you can configure session affinity based on the client's
IP address. Read [session affinity](/docs/reference/networking/virtual-ips/#session-affinity)
to learn more.

## External IPs

If there are external IPs that route to one or more cluster nodes, Kubernetes Services
can be exposed on those `externalIPs`. When network traffic arrives into the cluster, with
the external IP (as destination IP) and the port matching that Service, rules and routes
that Kubernetes has configured ensure that the traffic is routed to one of the endpoints
for that Service.

When you define a Service, you can specify `externalIPs` for any
[service type](#publishing-services-service-types).
In the example below, the Service named `"my-service"` can be accessed by clients using TCP,
on `"198.51.100.32:80"` (calculated from `.spec.externalIPs[]` and `.spec.ports[].port`).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: MyApp
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 49152
  externalIPs:
    - 198.51.100.32
```

{{< note >}}
Kubernetes does not manage allocation of `externalIPs`; these are the responsibility
of the cluster administrator.

## API Object

Service is a top-level resource in the Kubernetes REST API. You can find more details
about the [Service API object](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#service-v1-core).
