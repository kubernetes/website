<!-- overview -->

In order to support latency-critical and high-throughput workloads, Kubernetes offers a suite of
Resource Managers. The managers aim to co-ordinate and optimise the alignment of node's resources for pods
configured with a specific requirement for CPUs, devices, and memory (hugepages) resources.

<!-- body -->

## Hardware topology alignment policies

_Topology Manager_ is a kubelet component that aims to coordinate the set of components that are
responsible for these optimizations. The overall resource management process is governed using
the policy you specify. To learn more, read
[Control Topology Management Policies on a Node](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/).

## Policies for assigning CPUs to Pods

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="CPUManager" >}}

Once a Pod is bound to a Node, the kubelet on that node may need to either multiplex the existing
hardware (for example, sharing CPUs across multiple Pods) or allocate hardware by dedicating some
resource (for example, assigning one of more CPUs for a Pod's exclusive use).

By default, the kubelet uses [CFS quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler)
to enforce pod CPU limits.  When the node runs many CPU-bound pods, the workload can move to
different CPU cores depending on whether the pod is throttled and which CPU cores are available
at scheduling time. Many workloads are not sensitive to this migration and thus
work fine without any intervention.

However, in workloads where CPU cache affinity and scheduling latency significantly affect
workload performance, the kubelet allows alternative CPU
management policies to determine some placement preferences on the node.
This is implemented using the _CPU Manager_ and its policy.
There are two available policies:

- `none`: the `none` policy explicitly enables the existing default CPU
  affinity scheme, providing no affinity beyond what the OS scheduler does
  automatically.  Limits on CPU usage for
  [Guaranteed pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/) and
  [Burstable pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-qos/)
  are enforced using CFS quota.
- `static`: the `static` policy allows containers in `Guaranteed` pods with integer CPU
  `requests` access to exclusive CPUs on the node. This exclusivity is enforced
  using the [cpuset cgroup controller](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt).

{{< note >}}
System services such as the container runtime and the kubelet itself can continue to run on
these exclusive CPUs.  The exclusivity only extends to other pods.
{{< /note >}}

CPU Manager doesn't support offlining and onlining of CPUs at runtime.

### Static policy

The static policy enables finer-grained CPU management and exclusive CPU assignment.
This policy manages a shared pool of CPUs that initially contains all CPUs in the
node. The amount of exclusively allocatable CPUs is equal to the total
number of CPUs in the node minus any CPU reservations set by the kubelet configuration.
CPUs reserved by these options are taken, in integer quantity, from the initial shared pool in ascending order by physical
core ID.  This shared pool is the set of CPUs on which any containers in
`BestEffort` and `Burstable` pods run. Containers in `Guaranteed` pods with fractional
CPU `requests` also run on CPUs in the shared pool. Only containers that are
part of a `Guaranteed` pod and have integer CPU `requests` are assigned
exclusive CPUs.

{{< note >}}
The kubelet requires a CPU reservation greater than zero when the static policy is enabled.
This is because a zero CPU reservation would allow the shared pool to become empty.
{{< /note >}}

As `Guaranteed` pods whose containers fit the requirements for being statically
assigned are scheduled to the node, CPUs are removed from the shared pool and
placed in the cpuset for the container. CFS quota is not used to bound
the CPU usage of these containers as their usage is bound by the scheduling domain
itself. In others words, the number of CPUs in the container cpuset is equal to the integer
CPU `limit` specified in the pod spec. This static assignment increases CPU
affinity and decreases context switches due to throttling for the CPU-bound
workload.

Consider the containers in the following pod specs:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

The pod above runs in the `BestEffort` QoS class because no resource `requests` or
`limits` are specified. It runs in the shared pool.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
```

The pod above runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because resource `requests` do not
equal `limits` and the `cpu` quantity is not specified. It runs in the shared
pool.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
      requests:
        memory: "100Mi"
        cpu: "1"
```

The pod above runs in the `Burstable` QoS class because resource `requests` do not
equal `limits`. It runs in the shared pool.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
```

The pod above runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class because `requests` are equal to `limits`.
And the container's resource limit for the CPU resource is an integer greater than
or equal to one. The `nginx` container is granted 2 exclusive CPUs.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "1.5"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "1.5"
```

The pod above runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class because `requests` are equal to `limits`.
But the container's resource limit for the CPU resource is a fraction. It runs in
the shared pool.

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "2"
```

The pod above runs in the `Guaranteed` QoS class because only `limits` are specified
and `requests` are set equal to `limits` when not explicitly specified. And the
container's resource limit for the CPU resource is an integer greater than or
equal to one. The `nginx` container is granted 2 exclusive CPUs.

#### Static policy options {#cpu-policy-static--options}

Here are the available policy options for the static CPU management policy,
listed in alphabetical order:

`align-by-socket` (alpha, hidden by default)
: Align CPUs by physical package / socket boundary, rather than logical NUMA boundaries
  (available since Kubernetes v1.25)

`distribute-cpus-across-cores` (alpha, hidden by default)
: Allocate virtual cores, sometimes called hardware threads, across different physical cores
  (available since Kubernetes v1.31)

`distribute-cpus-across-numa` (alpha, hidden by default)
: Spread CPUs across different NUMA domains, aiming for an even balance between the selected domains
  (available since Kubernetes v1.23)

`full-pcpus-only` (beta, visible by default)
: Always allocate full physical cores (available since Kubernetes v1.22)

`strict-cpu-reservation` (alpha, hidden by default)
: Prevent all the pods regardless of their Quality of Service class to run on reserved CPUs
  (available since Kubernetes v1.32)

`prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache` (alpha, hidden by default)
: Align CPUs by uncore (Last-Level) cache boundary on a best-effort way
  (available since Kubernetes v1.32)

You can toggle groups of options on and off based upon their maturity level
using the following feature gates:

* `CPUManagerPolicyBetaOptions` (default enabled). Disable to hide beta-level options.
* `CPUManagerPolicyAlphaOptions` (default disabled). Enable to show alpha-level options.

You will still have to enable each option using the `cpuManagerPolicyOptions` field in the
kubelet configuration file.

For more detail about the individual options you can configure, read on.

##### `full-pcpus-only`

If the `full-pcpus-only` policy option is specified, the static policy will always allocate full physical cores.
By default, without this option, the static policy allocates CPUs using a topology-aware best-fit allocation.
On SMT enabled systems, the policy can allocate individual virtual cores, which correspond to hardware threads.
This can lead to different containers sharing the same physical cores; this behaviour in turn contributes
to the [noisy neighbours problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_issues#Performance_interference_and_noisy_neighbors).
With the option enabled, the pod will be admitted by the kubelet only if the CPU request of all its containers
can be fulfilled by allocating full physical cores.
If the pod does not pass the admission, it will be put in Failed state with the message `SMTAlignmentError`.

##### `distribute-cpus-across-numa`

If the `distribute-cpus-across-numa`policy option is specified, the static
policy will evenly distribute CPUs across NUMA nodes in cases where more than
one NUMA node is required to satisfy the allocation.
By default, the `CPUManager` will pack CPUs onto one NUMA node until it is
filled, with any remaining CPUs simply spilling over to the next NUMA node.
This can cause undesired bottlenecks in parallel code relying on barriers (and
similar synchronization primitives), as this type of code tends to run only as
fast as its slowest worker (which is slowed down by the fact that fewer CPUs
are available on at least one NUMA node).
By distributing CPUs evenly across NUMA nodes, application developers can more
easily ensure that no single worker suffers from NUMA effects more than any
other, improving the overall performance of these types of applications.

##### `align-by-socket`

If the `align-by-socket` policy option is specified, CPUs will be considered
aligned at the socket boundary when deciding how to allocate CPUs to a
container. By default, the `CPUManager` aligns CPU allocations at the NUMA
boundary, which could result in performance degradation if CPUs need to be
pulled from more than one NUMA node to satisfy the allocation. Although it
tries to ensure that all CPUs are allocated from the _minimum_ number of NUMA
nodes, there is no guarantee that those NUMA nodes will be on the same socket.
By directing the `CPUManager` to explicitly align CPUs at the socket boundary
rather than the NUMA boundary, we are able to avoid such issues. Note, this
policy option is not compatible with `TopologyManager` `single-numa-node`
policy and does not apply to hardware where the number of sockets is greater
than number of NUMA nodes.

##### `distribute-cpus-across-cores`

If the `distribute-cpus-across-cores` policy option is specified, the static policy
will attempt to allocate virtual cores (hardware threads) across different physical cores.
By default, the `CPUManager` tends to pack CPUs onto as few physical cores as possible,
which can lead to contention among CPUs on the same physical core and result
in performance bottlenecks. By enabling the `distribute-cpus-across-cores` policy,
the static policy ensures that CPUs are distributed across as many physical cores
as possible, reducing the contention on the same physical core and thereby
improving overall performance. However, it is important to note that this strategy
might be less effective when the system is heavily loaded. Under such conditions,
the benefit of reducing contention diminishes. Conversely, default behavior
can help in reducing inter-core communication overhead, potentially providing
better performance under high load conditions.

##### `strict-cpu-reservation`

The `reservedSystemCPUs` parameter in [KubeletConfiguration](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/),
or the deprecated kubelet command line option `--reserved-cpus`, defines an explicit CPU set for OS system daemons
and kubernetes system daemons. More details of this parameter can be found on the
[Explicitly Reserved CPU List](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#explicitly-reserved-cpu-list) page.
By default, this isolation is implemented only for guaranteed pods with integer CPU requests not for burstable and best-effort pods
(and guaranteed pods with fractional CPU requests). Admission is only comparing the CPU requests against the allocatable CPUs.
Since the CPU limit is higher than the request, the default behaviour allows burstable and best-effort pods to use up the capacity
of `reservedSystemCPUs` and cause host OS services to starve in real life deployments.
If the `strict-cpu-reservation` policy option is enabled, the static policy will not allow
any workload to use the CPU cores specified in `reservedSystemCPUs`.

##### `prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache`

If the `prefer-align-cpus-by-uncorecache` policy is specified, the static policy
will allocate CPU resources for individual containers such that all CPUs assigned
to a container share the same uncore cache block (also known as the Last-Level Cache
or LLC). By default, the `CPUManager` will tightly pack CPU assignments which can
result in containers being assigned CPUs from multiple uncore caches. This option
enables the `CPUManager` to allocate CPUs in a way that maximizes the efficient use
of the uncore cache. Allocation is performed on a best-effort basis, aiming to
affine as many CPUs as possible within the same uncore cache. If the container's
CPU requirement exceeds the CPU capacity of a single uncore cache, the `CPUManager`
minimizes the number of uncore caches used in order to maintain optimal uncore
cache alignment. Specific workloads can benefit in performance from the reduction
of inter-cache latency and noisy neighbors at the cache level. If the `CPUManager`
cannot align optimally while the node has sufficient resources, the container will
still be admitted using the default packed behavior.

## Memory Management Policies

{{< feature-state feature_gate_name="MemoryManager" >}}

The Kubernetes *Memory Manager* enables the feature of guaranteed memory (and hugepages)
allocation for pods in the `Guaranteed` {{< glossary_tooltip text="QoS class" term_id="qos-class" >}}.

The Memory Manager employs hint generation protocol to yield the most suitable NUMA affinity for a pod.
The Memory Manager feeds the central manager (*Topology Manager*) with these affinity hints.
Based on both the hints and Topology Manager policy, the pod is rejected or admitted to the node.

Moreover, the Memory Manager ensures that the memory which a pod requests
is allocated from a minimum number of NUMA nodes.

## Other resource managers

The configuration of individual managers is elaborated in dedicated documents:
