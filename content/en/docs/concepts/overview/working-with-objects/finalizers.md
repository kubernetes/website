{{<glossary_definition term_id="finalizer" length="long">}}

You can use finalizers to control {{<glossary_tooltip text="garbage collection" term_id="garbage-collection">}}
of {{< glossary_tooltip text="objects" term_id="object" >}} by alerting {{<glossary_tooltip text="controllers" term_id="controller">}}
to perform specific cleanup tasks before deleting the target resource.

Finalizers don't usually specify the code to execute. Instead, they are
typically lists of keys on a specific resource similar to annotations.
Kubernetes specifies some finalizers automatically, but you can also specify
your own.

## How finalizers work

When you create a resource using a manifest file, you can specify finalizers in
the `metadata.finalizers` field. When you attempt to delete the resource, the
API server handling the delete request notices the values in the `finalizers` field
and does the following: 

  * Modifies the object to add a `metadata.deletionTimestamp` field with the
    time you started the deletion.
  * Prevents the object from being removed until all items are removed from its `metadata.finalizers` field
  * Returns a `202` status code (HTTP "Accepted")

The controller managing that finalizer notices the update to the object setting the
`metadata.deletionTimestamp`, indicating deletion of the object has been requested.
The controller then attempts to satisfy the requirements of the finalizers
specified for that resource. Each time a finalizer condition is satisfied, the
controller removes that key from the resource's `finalizers` field. When the
`finalizers` field is emptied, an object with a `deletionTimestamp` field set
is automatically deleted. You can also use finalizers to prevent deletion of unmanaged resources.

A common example of a finalizer is `kubernetes.io/pv-protection`, which prevents
accidental deletion of `PersistentVolume` objects. When a `PersistentVolume`
object is in use by a Pod, Kubernetes adds the `pv-protection` finalizer. If you
try to delete the `PersistentVolume`, it enters a `Terminating` status, but the
controller can't delete it because the finalizer exists. When the Pod stops
using the `PersistentVolume`, Kubernetes clears the `pv-protection` finalizer,
and the controller deletes the volume.

{{<note>}}
* When you `DELETE` an object, Kubernetes adds the deletion timestamp for that object and then
immediately starts to restrict changes to the `.metadata.finalizers` field for the object that is
now pending deletion. You can remove existing finalizers (deleting an entry from the `finalizers`
list) but you cannot add a new finalizer. You also cannot modify the `deletionTimestamp` for an
object once it is set.

* After the deletion is requested, you can not resurrect this object. The only way is to delete it and make a new similar object.

## Owner references, labels, and finalizers {#owners-labels-finalizers}

Like {{<glossary_tooltip text="labels" term_id="label">}},
[owner references](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/)
describe the relationships between objects in Kubernetes, but are used for a
different purpose. When a
{{<glossary_tooltip text="controller" term_id="controller">}} manages objects
like Pods, it uses labels to track changes to groups of related objects. For
example, when a {{<glossary_tooltip text="Job" term_id="job">}} creates one or
more Pods, the Job controller applies labels to those pods and tracks changes to
any Pods in the cluster with the same label.

The Job controller also adds *owner references* to those Pods, pointing at the
Job that created the Pods. If you delete the Job while these Pods are running,
Kubernetes uses the owner references (not labels) to determine which Pods in the
cluster need cleanup.

Kubernetes also processes finalizers when it identifies owner references on a
resource targeted for deletion. 

In some situations, finalizers can block the deletion of dependent objects,
which can cause the targeted owner object to remain for
longer than expected without being fully deleted. In these situations, you
should check finalizers and owner references on the target owner and dependent
objects to troubleshoot the cause. 

{{<note>}}
In cases where objects are stuck in a deleting state, avoid manually
removing finalizers to allow deletion to continue. Finalizers are usually added
to resources for a reason, so forcefully removing them can lead to issues in
your cluster. This should only be done when the purpose of the finalizer is
understood and is accomplished in another way (for example, manually cleaning
up some dependent object).
