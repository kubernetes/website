ConfigMap does not provide secrecy or encryption.
If the data you want to store are confidential, use a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="Secret" term_id="secret" >}} rather than a ConfigMap,
or use additional (third party) tools to keep your data private.

## Motivation

Use a ConfigMap for setting configuration data separately from application code.

For example, imagine that you are developing an application that you can run on your
own computer (for development) and in the cloud (to handle real traffic).
You write the code to look in an environment variable named `DATABASE_HOST`.
Locally, you set that variable to `localhost`. In the cloud, you set it to
refer to a Kubernetes {{< glossary_tooltip text="Service" term_id="service" >}}
that exposes the database component to your cluster.
This lets you fetch a container image running in the cloud and
debug the exact same code locally if needed.

A ConfigMap is not designed to hold large chunks of data. The data stored in a
ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB. If you need to store settings that are
larger than this limit, you may want to consider mounting a volume or use a
separate database or file service.

## ConfigMap object

A ConfigMap is an API [object](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
that lets you store configuration for other objects to use. Unlike most
Kubernetes objects that have a `spec`, a ConfigMap has `data` and `binaryData`
fields. These fields accept key-value pairs as their values.  Both the `data`
field and the `binaryData` are optional. The `data` field is designed to
contain UTF-8 byte sequences while the `binaryData` field is designed to
contain binary data as base64-encoded strings.

The name of a ConfigMap must be a valid
[DNS subdomain name](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names).

Each key under the `data` or the `binaryData` field must consist of
alphanumeric characters, `-`, `_` or `.`. The keys stored in `data` must not
overlap with the keys in the `binaryData` field.

Starting from v1.19, you can add an `immutable` field to a ConfigMap
definition to create an [immutable ConfigMap](#configmap-immutable).

## ConfigMaps and Pods

You can write a Pod `spec` that refers to a ConfigMap and configures the container(s)
in that Pod based on the data in the ConfigMap. The Pod and the ConfigMap must be in
the same {{< glossary_tooltip text="namespace" term_id="namespace" >}}.

Here's an example ConfigMap that has some keys with single values,
and other keys where the value looks like a fragment of a configuration
format.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: game-demo
data:
  # property-like keys; each key maps to a simple value
  player_initial_lives: "3"
  ui_properties_file_name: "user-interface.properties"

  # file-like keys
  game.properties: |
    enemy.types=aliens,monsters
    player.maximum-lives=5
  user-interface.properties: |
    color.good=purple
    color.bad=yellow
    allow.textmode=true
```

There are four different ways that you can use a ConfigMap to configure
a container inside a Pod:

1. Inside a container command and args
1. Environment variables for a container
1. Add a file in read-only volume, for the application to read
1. Write code to run inside the Pod that uses the Kubernetes API to read a ConfigMap

These different methods lend themselves to different ways of modeling
the data being consumed.
For the first three methods, the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="kubelet" term_id="kubelet" >}} uses the data from
the ConfigMap when it launches container(s) for a Pod.

The fourth method means you have to write code to read the ConfigMap and its data.
However, because you're using the Kubernetes API directly, your application can
subscribe to get updates whenever the ConfigMap changes, and react
when that happens. By accessing the Kubernetes API directly, this
technique also lets you access a ConfigMap in a different namespace.

Here's an example Pod that uses values from `game-demo` to configure a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-demo-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: demo
      image: alpine
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      env:
        # Define the environment variable
        - name: PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES # Notice that the case is different here
                                     # from the key name in the ConfigMap.
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: game-demo           # The ConfigMap this value comes from.
              key: player_initial_lives # The key to fetch.
        - name: UI_PROPERTIES_FILE_NAME
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: game-demo
              key: ui_properties_file_name
      volumeMounts:
      - name: config
        mountPath: "/config"
        readOnly: true
  volumes:
    # You set volumes at the Pod level, then mount them into containers inside that Pod
    - name: config
      configMap:
        # Provide the name of the ConfigMap you want to mount.
        name: game-demo
        # An array of keys from the ConfigMap to create as files
        items:
        - key: "game.properties"
          path: "game.properties"
        - key: "user-interface.properties"
          path: "user-interface.properties"
```

A ConfigMap doesn't differentiate between single line property values and
multi-line file-like values.
What matters is how Pods and other objects consume those values.

For this example, defining a volume and mounting it inside the `demo`
container as `/config` creates two files,
`/config/game.properties` and `/config/user-interface.properties`,
even though there are four keys in the ConfigMap. This is because the Pod
definition specifies an `items` array in the `volumes` section.
If you omit the `items` array entirely, every key  in the ConfigMap becomes
a file with the same name as the key, and you get 4 files.

## Using ConfigMaps

ConfigMaps can be mounted as data volumes. ConfigMaps can also be used by other
parts of the system, without being directly exposed to the Pod. For example,
ConfigMaps can hold data that other parts of the system should use for configuration.

The most common way to use ConfigMaps is to configure settings for
containers running in a Pod in the same namespace. You can also use a
ConfigMap separately.

For example, you
might encounter {{< glossary_tooltip text="addons" term_id="addons" >}}
or {{< glossary_tooltip text="operators" term_id="operator-pattern" >}} that
adjust their behavior based on a ConfigMap.

### Using ConfigMaps as files from a Pod

To consume a ConfigMap in a volume in a Pod:

1. Create a ConfigMap or use an existing one. Multiple Pods can reference the
   same ConfigMap.
1. Modify your Pod definition to add a volume under `.spec.volumes[]`. Name
   the volume anything, and have a `.spec.volumes[].configMap.name` field set
   to reference your ConfigMap object.
1. Add a `.spec.containers[].volumeMounts[]` to each container that needs the
   ConfigMap. Specify `.spec.containers[].volumeMounts[].readOnly = true` and
   `.spec.containers[].volumeMounts[].mountPath` to an unused directory name
   where you would like the ConfigMap to appear.
1. Modify your image or command line so that the program looks for files in
   that directory. Each key in the ConfigMap `data` map becomes the filename
   under `mountPath`.

This is an example of a Pod that mounts a ConfigMap in a volume:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mypod
    image: redis
    volumeMounts:
    - name: foo
      mountPath: "/etc/foo"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: foo
    configMap:
      name: myconfigmap
```

Each ConfigMap you want to use needs to be referred to in `.spec.volumes`.

If there are multiple containers in the Pod, then each container needs its
own `volumeMounts` block, but only one `.spec.volumes` is needed per ConfigMap.

#### Mounted ConfigMaps are updated automatically

When a ConfigMap currently consumed in a volume is updated, projected keys are eventually updated as well.
The kubelet checks whether the mounted ConfigMap is fresh on every periodic sync.
However, the kubelet uses its local cache for getting the current value of the ConfigMap.
The type of the cache is configurable using the `ConfigMapAndSecretChangeDetectionStrategy` field in
the [KubeletConfiguration struct](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/)).
A ConfigMap can be either propagated by watch (default), ttl-based, or by redirecting
all requests directly to the API server.
As a result, the total delay from the moment when the ConfigMap is updated to the moment
when new keys are projected to the Pod can be as long as the kubelet sync period + cache
propagation delay, where the cache propagation delay depends on the chosen cache type
(it equals to watch propagation delay, ttl of cache, or zero correspondingly).

ConfigMaps consumed as environment variables are not updated automatically and require a pod restart. 

## Immutable ConfigMaps {#configmap-immutable}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.21" state="stable" >}}

The Kubernetes feature _Immutable Secrets and ConfigMaps_ provides an option to set
individual Secrets and ConfigMaps as immutable. For clusters that extensively use ConfigMaps
(at least tens of thousands of unique ConfigMap to Pod mounts), preventing changes to their
data has the following advantages:

- protects you from accidental (or unwanted) updates that could cause applications outages
- improves performance of your cluster by significantly reducing load on kube-apiserver, by
  closing watches for ConfigMaps marked as immutable.

This feature is controlled by the `ImmutableEphemeralVolumes`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).
You can create an immutable ConfigMap by setting the `immutable` field to `true`.
For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  ...
data:
  ...
immutable: true
```

Once a ConfigMap is marked as immutable, it is _not_ possible to revert this change
nor to mutate the contents of the `data` or the `binaryData` field. You can
only delete and recreate the ConfigMap. Because existing Pods maintain a mount point
to the deleted ConfigMap, it is recommended to recreate these pods.
