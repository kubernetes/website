<!-- overview -->

When you specify a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="pod" >}}, you can optionally specify how much of each resource a 
{{< glossary_tooltip text="container" term_id="container" >}} needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory 
(RAM); there are others.

When you specify the resource _request_ for containers in a Pod, the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="kube-scheduler" term_id="kube-scheduler" >}} uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on. 
When you specify a resource _limit_ for a container, the {{< glossary_tooltip text="kubelet" term_id="kubelet" >}} enforces those 
limits so that the running container is not allowed to use more of that resource 
than the limit you set. The kubelet also reserves at least the _request_ amount of 
that system resource specifically for that container to use.

<!-- body -->

## Requests and limits

If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and
allowed) for a container to use more resource than its `request` for that resource specifies.
However, a container is not allowed to use more than its resource `limit`.

For example, if you set a `memory` request of 256 MiB for a container, and that container is in
a Pod scheduled to a Node with 8GiB of memory and no other Pods, then the container can try to use
more RAM.

If you set a `memory` limit of 4GiB for that container, the kubelet (and
{{< glossary_tooltip text="container runtime" term_id="container-runtime" >}}) enforce the limit.
The runtime prevents the container from using more than the configured resource limit. For example:
when a process in the container tries to consume more than the allowed amount of memory,
the system kernel terminates the process that attempted the allocation, with an out of memory
(OOM) error.

Limits can be implemented either reactively (the system intervenes once it sees a violation)
or by enforcement (the system prevents the container from ever exceeding the limit). Different
runtimes can have different ways to implement the same restrictions.

{{< note >}}
If you specify a limit for a resource, but do not specify any request, and no admission-time
mechanism has applied a default request for that resource, then Kubernetes copies the limit
you specified and uses it as the requested value for the resource.
{{< /note >}}

## Resource types

*CPU* and *memory* are each a *resource type*. A resource type has a base unit.
CPU represents compute processing and is specified in units of [Kubernetes CPUs](#meaning-of-cpu).
Memory is specified in units of bytes.
For Linux workloads, you can specify _huge page_ resources.
Huge pages are a Linux-specific feature where the node kernel allocates blocks of memory
that are much larger than the default page size.

For example, on a system where the default page size is 4KiB, you could specify a limit,
`hugepages-2Mi: 80Mi`. If the container tries allocating over 40 2MiB huge pages (a
total of 80 MiB), that allocation fails.

{{< note >}}
You cannot overcommit `hugepages-*` resources.
This is different from the `memory` and `cpu` resources.
{{< /note >}}

CPU and memory are collectively referred to as *compute resources*, or *resources*. Compute
resources are measurable quantities that can be requested, allocated, and
consumed. They are distinct from
[API resources](/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/). API resources, such as Pods and
[Services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) are objects that can be read and modified
through the Kubernetes API server.

## Resource requests and limits of Pod and container

For each container, you can specify resource limits and requests,
including the following:

* `spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu`
* `spec.containers[].resources.limits.memory`
* `spec.containers[].resources.limits.hugepages-<size>`
* `spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu`
* `spec.containers[].resources.requests.memory`
* `spec.containers[].resources.requests.hugepages-<size>`

Although you can only specify requests and limits for individual containers,
it is also useful to think about the overall resource requests and limits for
a Pod.
For a particular resource, a *Pod resource request/limit* is the sum of the
resource requests/limits of that type for each container in the Pod.

## Resource units in Kubernetes

### CPU resource units {#meaning-of-cpu}

Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in *cpu* units.
In Kubernetes, 1 CPU unit is equivalent to **1 physical CPU core**,
or **1 virtual core**, depending on whether the node is a physical host
or a virtual machine running inside a physical machine.

Fractional requests are allowed. When you define a container with
`spec.containers[].resources.requests.cpu` set to `0.5`, you are requesting half
as much CPU time compared to if you asked for `1.0` CPU.
For CPU resource units, the [quantity](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/) expression `0.1` is equivalent to the
expression `100m`, which can be read as "one hundred millicpu". Some people say
"one hundred millicores", and this is understood to mean the same thing.

CPU resource is always specified as an absolute amount of resource, never as a relative amount. For example,
`500m` CPU represents the roughly same amount of computing power whether that container
runs on a single-core, dual-core, or 48-core machine.

{{< note >}}
Kubernetes doesn't allow you to specify CPU resources with a precision finer than
`1m`. Because of this, it's useful to specify CPU units less than `1.0` or `1000m` using
the milliCPU form; for example, `5m` rather than `0.005`.
{{< /note >}}

### Memory resource units {#meaning-of-memory}

Limits and requests for `memory` are measured in bytes. You can express memory as
a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these
[quantity](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/quantity/) suffixes:
E, P, T, G, M, k. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi,
Mi, Ki. For example, the following represent roughly the same value:

```shell
128974848, 129e6, 129M,  128974848000m, 123Mi
```

Pay attention to the case of the suffixes. If you request `400m` of memory, this is a request
for 0.4 bytes. Someone who types that probably meant to ask for 400 mebibytes (`400Mi`)
or 400 megabytes (`400M`).

## Container resources example {#example-1}

The following Pod has two containers. Both containers are defined with a request for
0.25 CPU
and 64MiB (2<sup>26</sup> bytes) of memory. Each container has a limit of 0.5
CPU and 128MiB of memory. You can say the Pod has a request of 0.5 CPU and 128
MiB of memory, and a limit of 1 CPU and 256MiB of memory.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
  - name: log-aggregator
    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"
```

## How Pods with resource requests are scheduled

When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to
run on. Each node has a maximum capacity for each of the resource types: the
amount of CPU and memory it can provide for Pods. The scheduler ensures that,
for each resource type, the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled
containers is less than the capacity of the node.
Note that although actual memory
or CPU resource usage on nodes is very low, the scheduler still refuses to place
a Pod on a node if the capacity check fails. This protects against a resource
shortage on a node when resource usage later increases, for example, during a
daily peak in request rate.

## How Kubernetes applies resource requests and limits {#how-pods-with-resource-limits-are-run}

When the kubelet starts a container as part of a Pod, the kubelet passes that container's
requests and limits for memory and CPU to the container runtime.

On Linux, the container runtime typically configures
kernel {{< glossary_tooltip text="cgroups" term_id="cgroup" >}} that apply and enforce the
limits you defined.

- The CPU limit defines a hard ceiling on how much CPU time that the container can use.
  During each scheduling interval (time slice), the Linux kernel checks to see if this
  limit is exceeded; if so, the kernel waits before allowing that cgroup to resume execution.
- The CPU request typically defines a weighting. If several different containers (cgroups)
  want to run on a contended system, workloads with larger CPU requests are allocated more
  CPU time than workloads with small requests.
- The memory request is mainly used during (Kubernetes) Pod scheduling. On a node that uses
  cgroups v2, the container runtime might use the memory request as a hint to set
  `memory.min` and `memory.low`.
- The memory limit defines a memory limit for that cgroup. If the container tries to
  allocate more memory than this limit, the Linux kernel out-of-memory subsystem activates
  and, typically, intervenes by stopping one of the processes in the container that tried
  to allocate memory. If that process is the container's PID 1, and the container is marked
  as restartable, Kubernetes restarts the container.
- The memory limit for the Pod or container can also apply to pages in memory backed
  volumes, such as an `emptyDir`. The kubelet tracks `tmpfs` emptyDir volumes as container
  memory use, rather than as local ephemeral storage.

If a container exceeds its memory request and the node that it runs on becomes short of
memory overall, it is likely that the Pod the container belongs to will be
{{< glossary_tooltip text="evicted" term_id="eviction" >}}.

A container might or might not be allowed to exceed its CPU limit for extended periods of time.
However, container runtimes don't terminate Pods or containers for excessive CPU usage.

To determine whether a container cannot be scheduled or is being killed due to resource limits,
see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Monitoring compute & memory resource usage

The kubelet reports the resource usage of a Pod as part of the Pod
[`status`](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/#object-spec-and-status).

If optional [tools for monitoring](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-usage-monitoring/)
are available in your cluster, then Pod resource usage can be retrieved either
from the [Metrics API](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-api)
directly or from your monitoring tools.

## Local ephemeral storage

<!-- feature gate LocalStorageCapacityIsolation -->
{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.25" state="stable" >}}

Nodes have local ephemeral storage, backed by
locally-attached writeable devices or, sometimes, by RAM.
"Ephemeral" means that there is no long-term guarantee about durability.

Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and for logs.
The kubelet can provide scratch space to Pods using local ephemeral storage to
mount [`emptyDir`](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir)
 {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="volume" text="volumes" >}} into containers.

The kubelet also uses this kind of storage to hold
[node-level container logs](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#logging-at-the-node-level),
container images, and the writable layers of running containers.

{{< caution >}}
If a node fails, the data in its ephemeral storage can be lost.
Your applications cannot expect any performance SLAs (disk IOPS for example)
from local ephemeral storage.
{{< /caution >}}


{{< note >}}
To make the resource quota work on ephemeral-storage, two things need to be done:

* An admin sets the resource quota for ephemeral-storage in a namespace.
* A user needs to specify limits for the ephemeral-storage resource in the Pod spec.

If the user doesn't specify the ephemeral-storage resource limit in the Pod spec,
the resource quota is not enforced on ephemeral-storage.

{{< /note >}}

Kubernetes lets you track, reserve and limit the amount
of ephemeral local storage a Pod can consume.

### Configurations for local ephemeral storage

Kubernetes supports two ways to configure local ephemeral storage on a node:
{{< tabs name="local_storage_configurations" >}}
{{% tab name="Single filesystem" %}}
In this configuration, you place all different kinds of ephemeral local data
(`emptyDir` volumes, writeable layers, container images, logs) into one filesystem.
The most effective way to configure the kubelet means dedicating this filesystem
to Kubernetes (kubelet) data.

The kubelet also writes
[node-level container logs](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#logging-at-the-node-level)
and treats these similarly to ephemeral local storage.

The kubelet writes logs to files inside its configured log directory (`/var/log`
by default); and has a base directory for other locally stored data
(`/var/lib/kubelet` by default).

Typically, both `/var/lib/kubelet` and `/var/log` are on the system root filesystem,
and the kubelet is designed with that layout in mind.

Your node can have as many other filesystems, not used for Kubernetes,
as you like.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Two filesystems" %}}
You have a filesystem on the node that you're using for ephemeral data that
comes from running Pods: logs, and `emptyDir` volumes. You can use this filesystem
for other data (for example: system logs not related to Kubernetes); it can even
be the root filesystem.

The kubelet also writes
[node-level container logs](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/#logging-at-the-node-level)
into the first filesystem, and treats these similarly to ephemeral local storage.

You also use a separate filesystem, backed by a different logical storage device.
In this configuration, the directory where you tell the kubelet to place
container image layers and writeable layers is on this second filesystem.

The first filesystem does not hold any image layers or writeable layers.

Your node can have as many other filesystems, not used for Kubernetes,
as you like.
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

The kubelet can measure how much local storage it is using. It does this provided
that you have set up the node using one of the supported configurations for local
ephemeral storage.

If you have a different configuration, then the kubelet does not apply resource
limits for ephemeral local storage.

{{< note >}}
The kubelet tracks `tmpfs` emptyDir volumes as container memory use, rather
than as local ephemeral storage.
{{< /note >}}

{{< note >}}
The kubelet will only track the root filesystem for ephemeral storage. OS layouts that mount a separate disk to `/var/lib/kubelet` or `/var/lib/containers` will not report ephemeral storage correctly.
{{< /note >}}

### Setting requests and limits for local ephemeral storage

You can specify `ephemeral-storage` for managing local ephemeral storage. Each
container of a Pod can specify either or both of the following:

* `spec.containers[].resources.limits.ephemeral-storage`
* `spec.containers[].resources.requests.ephemeral-storage`

Limits and requests for `ephemeral-storage` are measured in byte quantities.
You can express storage as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these suffixes:
E, P, T, G, M, k. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi,
Mi, Ki. For example, the following quantities all represent roughly the same value:

- `128974848`
- `129e6`
- `129M`
- `123Mi`

Pay attention to the case of the suffixes. If you request `400m` of ephemeral-storage, this is a request
for 0.4 bytes. Someone who types that probably meant to ask for 400 mebibytes (`400Mi`)
or 400 megabytes (`400M`).

In the following example, the Pod has two containers. Each container has a request of
2GiB of local ephemeral storage. Each container has a limit of 4GiB of local ephemeral
storage. Therefore, the Pod has a request of 4GiB of local ephemeral storage, and
a limit of 8GiB of local ephemeral storage. 500Mi of that limit could be
consumed by the `emptyDir` volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
    resources:
      requests:
        ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
      limits:
        ephemeral-storage: "4Gi"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: ephemeral
      mountPath: "/tmp"
  - name: log-aggregator
    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6
    resources:
      requests:
        ephemeral-storage: "2Gi"
      limits:
        ephemeral-storage: "4Gi"
    volumeMounts:
    - name: ephemeral
      mountPath: "/tmp"
  volumes:
    - name: ephemeral
      emptyDir:
        sizeLimit: 500Mi
```

### How Pods with ephemeral-storage requests are scheduled

When you create a Pod, the Kubernetes scheduler selects a node for the Pod to
run on. Each node has a maximum amount of local ephemeral storage it can provide for Pods.
For more information, see
[Node Allocatable](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable).

The scheduler ensures that the sum of the resource requests of the scheduled containers is less than the capacity of the node.

### Ephemeral storage consumption management {#resource-emphemeralstorage-consumption}

If the kubelet is managing local ephemeral storage as a resource, then the
kubelet measures storage use in:

- `emptyDir` volumes, except _tmpfs_ `emptyDir` volumes
- directories holding node-level logs
- writeable container layers

If a Pod is using more ephemeral storage than you allow it to, the kubelet
sets an eviction signal that triggers Pod eviction.

For container-level isolation, if a container's writable layer and log
usage exceeds its storage limit, the kubelet marks the Pod for eviction.

For pod-level isolation the kubelet works out an overall Pod storage limit by
summing the limits for the containers in that Pod. In this case, if the sum of
the local ephemeral storage usage from all containers and also the Pod's `emptyDir`
volumes exceeds the overall Pod storage limit, then the kubelet also marks the Pod
for eviction.

{{< caution >}}
If the kubelet is not measuring local ephemeral storage, then a Pod
that exceeds its local storage limit will not be evicted for breaching
local storage resource limits.

However, if the filesystem space for writeable container layers, node-level logs,
or `emptyDir` volumes falls low, the node
{{< glossary_tooltip text="taints" term_id="taint" >}} itself as short on local storage
and this taint triggers eviction for any Pods that don't specifically tolerate the taint.

See the supported [configurations](#configurations-for-local-ephemeral-storage)
for ephemeral local storage.
{{< /caution >}}

The kubelet supports different ways to measure Pod storage use:

{{< tabs name="resource-emphemeralstorage-measurement" >}}
{{% tab name="Periodic scanning" %}}
The kubelet performs regular, scheduled checks that scan each
`emptyDir` volume, container log directory, and writeable container layer.

The scan measures how much space is used.

{{< note >}}
In this mode, the kubelet does not track open file descriptors
for deleted files.

If you (or a container) create a file inside an `emptyDir` volume,
something then opens that file, and you delete the file while it is
still open, then the inode for the deleted file stays until you close
that file but the kubelet does not categorize the space as in use.
{{< /note >}}
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Filesystem project quota" %}}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.15" state="alpha" >}}

Project quotas are an operating-system level feature for managing
storage use on filesystems. With Kubernetes, you can enable project
quotas for monitoring storage use. Make sure that the filesystem
backing the `emptyDir` volumes, on the node, provides project quota support.
For example, XFS and ext4fs offer project quotas.

{{< note >}}
Project quotas let you monitor storage use; they do not enforce limits.
{{< /note >}}

Kubernetes uses project IDs starting from `1048576`. The IDs in use are
registered in `/etc/projects` and `/etc/projid`. If project IDs in
this range are used for other purposes on the system, those project
IDs must be registered in `/etc/projects` and `/etc/projid` so that
Kubernetes does not use them.

Quotas are faster and more accurate than directory scanning. When a
directory is assigned to a project, all files created under a
directory are created in that project, and the kernel merely has to
keep track of how many blocks are in use by files in that project.
If a file is created and deleted, but has an open file descriptor,
it continues to consume space. Quota tracking records that space accurately
whereas directory scans overlook the storage used by deleted files.

If you want to use project quotas, you should:

* Enable the `LocalStorageCapacityIsolationFSQuotaMonitoring=true`
  [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
  using the `featureGates` field in the
  [kubelet configuration](/docs/reference/config-api/kubelet-config.v1beta1/)
  or the `--feature-gates` command line flag.

* Ensure that the root filesystem (or optional runtime filesystem)
  has project quotas enabled. All XFS filesystems support project quotas.
  For ext4 filesystems, you need to enable the project quota tracking feature
  while the filesystem is not mounted.

  ```bash
  # For ext4, with /dev/block-device not mounted
  sudo tune2fs -O project -Q prjquota /dev/block-device
  ```

* Ensure that the root filesystem (or optional runtime filesystem) is
  mounted with project quotas enabled. For both XFS and ext4fs, the
  mount option is named `prjquota`.

## Extended resources

Extended resources are fully-qualified resource names outside the
`kubernetes.io` domain. They allow cluster operators to advertise and users to
consume the non-Kubernetes-built-in resources.

There are two steps required to use Extended Resources. First, the cluster
operator must advertise an Extended Resource. Second, users must request the
Extended Resource in Pods.

### Managing extended resources

#### Node-level extended resources

Node-level extended resources are tied to nodes.

##### Device plugin managed resources
See [Device
Plugin](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/)
for how to advertise device plugin managed resources on each node.

##### Other resources

To advertise a new node-level extended resource, the cluster operator can
submit a `PATCH` HTTP request to the API server to specify the available
quantity in the `status.capacity` for a node in the cluster. After this
operation, the node's `status.capacity` will include a new resource. The
`status.allocatable` field is updated automatically with the new resource
asynchronously by the kubelet.

Because the scheduler uses the node's `status.allocatable` value when
evaluating Pod fitness, the scheduler only takes account of the new value after
that asynchronous update. There may be a short delay between patching the
node capacity with a new resource and the time when the first Pod that requests
the resource can be scheduled on that node.

**Example:**

Here is an example showing how to use `curl` to form an HTTP request that
advertises five "example.com/foo" resources on node `k8s-node-1` whose master
is `k8s-master`.

```shell
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json-patch+json" \
--request PATCH \
--data '[{"op": "add", "path": "/status/capacity/example.com~1foo", "value": "5"}]' \
http://k8s-master:8080/api/v1/nodes/k8s-node-1/status
```

{{< note >}}
In the preceding request, `~1` is the encoding for the character `/`
in the patch path. The operation path value in JSON-Patch is interpreted as a
JSON-Pointer. For more details, see
[IETF RFC 6901, section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-3).
{{< /note >}}

#### Cluster-level extended resources

Cluster-level extended resources are not tied to nodes. They are usually managed
by scheduler extenders, which handle the resource consumption and resource quota.

You can specify the extended resources that are handled by scheduler extenders
in [scheduler configuration](/docs/reference/config-api/kube-scheduler-config.v1beta3/)

**Example:**

The following configuration for a scheduler policy indicates that the
cluster-level extended resource "example.com/foo" is handled by the scheduler
extender.

- The scheduler sends a Pod to the scheduler extender only if the Pod requests
     "example.com/foo".
- The `ignoredByScheduler` field specifies that the scheduler does not check
     the "example.com/foo" resource in its `PodFitsResources` predicate.

```json
{
  "kind": "Policy",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "extenders": [
    {
      "urlPrefix":"<extender-endpoint>",
      "bindVerb": "bind",
      "managedResources": [
        {
          "name": "example.com/foo",
          "ignoredByScheduler": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Consuming extended resources

Users can consume extended resources in Pod specs like CPU and memory.
The scheduler takes care of the resource accounting so that no more than the
available amount is simultaneously allocated to Pods.

The API server restricts quantities of extended resources to whole numbers.
Examples of _valid_ quantities are `3`, `3000m` and `3Ki`. Examples of
_invalid_ quantities are `0.5` and `1500m`.

{{< note >}}
Extended resources replace Opaque Integer Resources.
Users can use any domain name prefix other than `kubernetes.io` which is reserved.
{{< /note >}}

To consume an extended resource in a Pod, include the resource name as a key
in the `spec.containers[].resources.limits` map in the container spec.

{{< note >}}
Extended resources cannot be overcommitted, so request and limit
must be equal if both are present in a container spec.
{{< /note >}}

A Pod is scheduled only if all of the resource requests are satisfied, including
CPU, memory and any extended resources. The Pod remains in the `PENDING` state
as long as the resource request cannot be satisfied.

**Example:**

The Pod below requests 2 CPUs and 1 "example.com/foo" (an extended resource).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: myimage
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 2
        example.com/foo: 1
      limits:
        example.com/foo: 1
```

## PID limiting

Process ID (PID) limits allow for the configuration of a kubelet
to limit the number of PIDs that a given Pod can consume. See
[PID Limiting](/docs/concepts/policy/pid-limiting/) for information.

## Troubleshooting

### My Pods are pending with event message `FailedScheduling`

If the scheduler cannot find any node where a Pod can fit, the Pod remains
unscheduled until a place can be found. An
[Event](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) is produced
each time the scheduler fails to find a place for the Pod. You can use `kubectl`
to view the events for a Pod; for example:

```shell
kubectl describe pod frontend | grep -A 9999999999 Events
```
```
Events:
  Type     Reason            Age   From               Message
  ----     ------            ----  ----               -------
  Warning  FailedScheduling  23s   default-scheduler  0/42 nodes available: insufficient cpu
```

In the preceding example, the Pod named "frontend" fails to be scheduled due to
insufficient CPU resource on any node. Similar error messages can also suggest
failure due to insufficient memory (PodExceedsFreeMemory). In general, if a Pod
is pending with a message of this type, there are several things to try:

- Add more nodes to the cluster.
- Terminate unneeded Pods to make room for pending Pods.
- Check that the Pod is not larger than all the nodes. For example, if all the
  nodes have a capacity of `cpu: 1`, then a Pod with a request of `cpu: 1.1` will
  never be scheduled.
- Check for node taints. If most of your nodes are tainted, and the new Pod does
  not tolerate that taint, the scheduler only considers placements onto the
  remaining nodes that don't have that taint.

You can check node capacities and amounts allocated with the
`kubectl describe nodes` command. For example:

```shell
kubectl describe nodes e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4
```
```
Name:            e2e-test-node-pool-4lw4

In the preceding output, you can see that if a Pod requests more than 1.120 CPUs
or more than 6.23Gi of memory, that Pod will not fit on the node.

By looking at the “Pods” section, you can see which Pods are taking up space on
the node.

The amount of resources available to Pods is less than the node capacity because
system daemons use a portion of the available resources. Within the Kubernetes API,
each Node has a `.status.allocatable` field
(see [NodeStatus](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/node-v1/#NodeStatus)
for details).

The `.status.allocatable` field describes the amount of resources that are available
to Pods on that node (for example: 15 virtual CPUs and 7538 MiB of memory).
For more information on node allocatable resources in Kubernetes, see
[Reserve Compute Resources for System Daemons](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/).

You can configure [resource quotas](/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
to limit the total amount of resources that a namespace can consume.
Kubernetes enforces quotas for objects in particular namespace when there is a
ResourceQuota in that namespace.
For example, if you assign specific namespaces to different teams, you
can add ResourceQuotas into those namespaces. Setting resource quotas helps to
prevent one team from using so much of any resource that this over-use affects other teams.

You should also consider what access you grant to that namespace:
**full** write access to a namespace allows someone with that access to remove any
resource, including a configured ResourceQuota.

### My container is terminated

Your container might get terminated because it is resource-starved. To check
whether a container is being killed because it is hitting a resource limit, call
`kubectl describe pod` on the Pod of interest:

```shell
kubectl describe pod simmemleak-hra99
```

The output is similar to:
```
Name:                           simmemleak-hra99

```

In the preceding example, the `Restart Count:  5` indicates that the `simmemleak`
container in the Pod was terminated and restarted five times (so far).
The `OOMKilled` reason shows that the container tried to use more memory than its limit.

Your next step might be to check the application code for a memory leak. If you
find that the application is behaving how you expect, consider setting a higher
memory limit (and possibly request) for that container.
