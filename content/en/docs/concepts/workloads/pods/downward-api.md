  There are two ways to expose Pod and container fields to a running container:
  environment variables, and as files that are populated by a special volume type.
  Together, these two ways of exposing Pod and container fields are called the downward API.

<!-- overview -->

It is sometimes useful for a container to have information about itself, without
being overly coupled to Kubernetes. The _downward API_ allows containers to consume
information about themselves or the cluster without using the Kubernetes client
or API server.

An example is an existing application that assumes a particular well-known
environment variable holds a unique identifier. One possibility is to wrap the
application, but that is tedious and error-prone, and it violates the goal of low
coupling. A better option would be to use the Pod's name as an identifier, and
inject the Pod's name into the well-known environment variable.

In Kubernetes, there are two ways to expose Pod and container fields to a running container:

* as [environment variables](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
* as [files in a `downwardAPI` volume](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/)

Together, these two ways of exposing Pod and container fields are called the
_downward API_.

## Available fields

Only some Kubernetes API fields are available through the downward API. This
section lists which fields you can make available.

You can pass information from available Pod-level fields using `fieldRef`.
At the API level, the `spec` for a Pod always defines at least one
[Container](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#Container).
You can pass information from available Container-level fields using
`resourceFieldRef`.

### Information available via `fieldRef` {#downwardapi-fieldRef}

For most Pod-level fields, you can provide them to a container either as
an environment variable or using a `downwardAPI` volume. The fields available
via either mechanism are:

`metadata.name`
: the pod's name

`metadata.namespace`
: the pod's {{< glossary_tooltip text="namespace" term_id="namespace" >}}

`metadata.uid`
: the pod's unique ID

`metadata.annotations['<KEY>']`
: the value of the pod's {{< glossary_tooltip text="annotation" term_id="annotation" >}} named `<KEY>` (for example, `metadata.annotations['myannotation']`)

`metadata.labels['<KEY>']`
: the text value of the pod's {{< glossary_tooltip text="label" term_id="label" >}} named `<KEY>` (for example, `metadata.labels['mylabel']`)

The following information is available through environment variables
**but not as a downwardAPI volume fieldRef**:

`spec.serviceAccountName`
: the name of the pod's {{< glossary_tooltip text="service account" term_id="service-account" >}}

`spec.nodeName`
: the name of the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="node" text="node">}} where the Pod is executing

`status.hostIP`
: the primary IP address of the node to which the Pod is assigned

`status.podIP`
: the pod's primary IP address (usually, its IPv4 address)

The following information is available through a `downwardAPI` volume 
`fieldRef`, **but not as environment variables**:

`metadata.labels`
: all of the pod's labels, formatted as `label-key="escaped-label-value"` with one label per line

`metadata.annotations`
: all of the pod's annotations, formatted as `annotation-key="escaped-annotation-value"` with one annotation per line  

### Information available via `resourceFieldRef` {#downwardapi-resourceFieldRef}

These container-level fields allow you to provide information about
[requests and limits](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits)
for resources such as CPU and memory.


`resource: limits.cpu`
: A container's CPU limit

`resource: requests.cpu`
: A container's CPU request

`resource: limits.memory`
: A container's memory limit

`resource: requests.memory`
: A container's memory request

`resource: limits.hugepages-*`
: A container's hugepages limit

`resource: requests.hugepages-*`
: A container's hugepages request

`resource: limits.ephemeral-storage`
: A container's ephemeral-storage limit

`resource: requests.ephemeral-storage`
: A container's ephemeral-storage request

#### Fallback information for resource limits

If CPU and memory limits are not specified for a container, and you use the
downward API to try to expose that information, then the
kubelet defaults to exposing the maximum allocatable value for CPU and memory
based on the [node allocatable](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/reserve-compute-resources/#node-allocatable)
calculation.

You can read about [`downwardAPI` volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#downwardapi).

You can try using the downward API to expose container- or Pod-level information:
* as [environment variables](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/)
* as [files in `downwardAPI` volume](/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/)
