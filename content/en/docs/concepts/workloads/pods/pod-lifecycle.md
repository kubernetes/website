<!-- overview -->

This page describes the lifecycle of a Pod. Pods follow a defined lifecycle, starting
in the `Pending` [phase](#pod-phase), moving through `Running` if at least one
of its primary containers starts OK, and then through either the `Succeeded` or
`Failed` phases depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure.

Whilst a Pod is running, the kubelet is able to restart containers to handle some
kind of faults. Within a Pod, Kubernetes tracks different container
[states](#container-states) and handles

In the Kubernetes API, Pods have both a specification and an actual status. The
status for a Pod object consists of a set of [Pod conditions](#pod-conditions).
You can also inject [custom readiness information](#pod-readiness-gate) into the
condition data for a Pod, if that is useful to your application.

Pods are only [scheduled](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/) once in their lifetime.
Once a Pod is scheduled (assigned) to a Node, the Pod runs on that Node until it stops
or is [terminated](#pod-termination).

<!-- body -->

## Pod lifetime

Like individual application containers, Pods are considered to be relatively
ephemeral (rather than durable) entities. Pods are created, assigned a unique
ID ([UID](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#uids)), and scheduled
to nodes where they remain until termination (according to restart policy) or
deletion.  
If a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="node" >}} dies, the Pods scheduled to that node
are [scheduled for deletion](#pod-garbage-collection) after a timeout period.

Pods do not, by themselves, self-heal. If a Pod is scheduled to a
{{< glossary_tooltip text="node" term_id="node" >}} that then fails,
or if the scheduling operation itself fails, the Pod is deleted; likewise, a Pod won't
survive an eviction due to a lack of resources or Node maintenance. Kubernetes uses a
higher-level abstraction, called a
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="controller" text="controller" >}}, that handles the work of
managing the relatively disposable Pod instances.

A given Pod (as defined by a UID) is never "rescheduled" to a different node; instead,
that Pod can be replaced by a new, near-identical Pod, with even the same name if
desired, but with a different UID.

When something is said to have the same lifetime as a Pod, such as a
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="volume" text="volume" >}},
that means that the thing exists as long as that specific Pod (with that exact UID)
exists. If that Pod is deleted for any reason, and even if an identical replacement
is created, the related thing (a volume, in this example) is also destroyed and
created anew.

## Pod phase

A Pod's `status` field is a
[PodStatus](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#podstatus-v1-core)
object, which has a `phase` field.

The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its
lifecycle. The phase is not intended to be a comprehensive rollup of observations
of container or Pod state, nor is it intended to be a comprehensive state machine.

The number and meanings of Pod phase values are tightly guarded.
Other than what is documented here, nothing should be assumed about Pods that
have a given `phase` value.

Here are the possible values for `phase`:

Value | Description
:-----|:-----------
`Pending` | The Pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes cluster, but one or more of the containers has not been set up and made ready to run. This includes time a Pod spends waiting to be scheduled as well as the time spent downloading container images over the network.
`Running` | The Pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, or is in the process of starting or restarting.
`Succeeded` | All containers in the Pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted.
`Failed` | All containers in the Pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. That is, the container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system.
`Unknown` | For some reason the state of the Pod could not be obtained. This phase typically occurs due to an error in communicating with the node where the Pod should be running.

If a node dies or is disconnected from the rest of the cluster, Kubernetes
applies a policy for setting the `phase` of all Pods on the lost node to Failed.

## Container states

As well as the [phase](#pod-phase) of the Pod overall, Kubernetes tracks the state of
each container inside a Pod. You can use
[container lifecycle hooks](/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/) to
trigger events to run at certain points in a container's lifecycle.

Once the {{< glossary_tooltip text="scheduler" term_id="kube-scheduler" >}}
assigns a Pod to a Node, the kubelet starts creating containers for that Pod
using a {{< glossary_tooltip text="container runtime" term_id="container-runtime" >}}.
There are three possible container states: `Waiting`, `Running`, and `Terminated`.

To check the state of a Pod's containers, you can use
`kubectl describe pod <name-of-pod>`. The output shows the state for each container
within that Pod.

Each state has a specific meaning:

### `Waiting` {#container-state-waiting}

If a container is not in either the `Running` or `Terminated` state, it is `Waiting`.
A container in the `Waiting` state is still running the operations it requires in
order to complete start up: for example, pulling the container image from a container
image registry, or applying {{< glossary_tooltip text="Secret" term_id="secret" >}}
data.
When you use `kubectl` to query a Pod with a container that is `Waiting`, you also see
a Reason field to summarize why the container is in that state.

### `Running` {#container-state-running}

The `Running` status indicates that a container is executing without issues. If there
was a `postStart` hook configured, it has already executed and finished. When you use
`kubectl` to query a Pod with a container that is `Running`, you also see information
about when the container entered the `Running` state.

### `Terminated` {#container-state-terminated}

A container in the `Terminated` state began execution and then either ran to
completion or failed for some reason. When you use `kubectl` to query a Pod with
a container that is `Terminated`, you see a reason, an exit code, and the start and
finish time for that container's period of execution.

If a container has a `preStop` hook configured, that runs before the container enters
the `Terminated` state.

## Container restart policy {#restart-policy}

The `spec` of a Pod has a `restartPolicy` field with possible values Always, OnFailure,
and Never. The default value is Always.

The `restartPolicy` applies to all containers in the Pod. `restartPolicy` only
refers to restarts of the containers by the kubelet on the same node. After containers
in a Pod exit, the kubelet restarts them with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s,
40s, â€¦), that is capped at five minutes. Once a container has executed with no problems
for 10 minutes without any problems, the kubelet resets the restart backoff timer for
that container.

## Pod conditions

A Pod has a PodStatus, which has an array of
[PodConditions](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#podcondition-v1-core)
through which the Pod has or has not passed:

* `PodScheduled`: the Pod has been scheduled to a node.
* `ContainersReady`: all containers in the Pod are ready.
* `Initialized`: all [init containers](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
  have started successfully.
* `Ready`: the Pod is able to serve requests and should be added to the load
  balancing pools of all matching Services.

Field name           | Description
:--------------------|:-----------
`type`               | Name of this Pod condition.
`status`             | Indicates whether that condition is applicable, with possible values "`True`", "`False`", or "`Unknown`".
`lastProbeTime`      | Timestamp of when the Pod condition was last probed.
`lastTransitionTime` | Timestamp for when the Pod last transitioned from one status to another.
`reason`             | Machine-readable, UpperCamelCase text indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
`message`            | Human-readable message indicating details about the last status transition.


### Pod readiness {#pod-readiness-gate}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.14" state="stable" >}}

Your application can inject extra feedback or signals into PodStatus:
_Pod readiness_. To use this, set `readinessGates` in the Pod's `spec` to
specify a list of additional conditions that the kubelet evaluates for Pod readiness.

Readiness gates are determined by the current state of `status.condition`
fields for the Pod. If Kubernetes cannot find such a condition in the
`status.conditions` field of a Pod, the status of the condition
is defaulted to "`False`".

Here is an example:

```yaml
kind: Pod
...
spec:
  readinessGates:
    - conditionType: "www.example.com/feature-1"
status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready                              # a built in PodCondition
      status: "False"
      lastProbeTime: null
      lastTransitionTime: 2018-01-01T00:00:00Z
    - type: "www.example.com/feature-1"        # an extra PodCondition
      status: "False"
      lastProbeTime: null
      lastTransitionTime: 2018-01-01T00:00:00Z
  containerStatuses:
    - containerID: docker://abcd...
      ready: true
...
```

The Pod conditions you add must have names that meet the Kubernetes [label key format](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).


### Status for Pod readiness {#pod-readiness-status}

The `kubectl patch` command does not support patching object status.
To set these `status.conditions` for the pod, applications and
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="operator-pattern" text="operators">}} should use
the `PATCH` action.
You can use a [Kubernetes client library](/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/) to
write code that sets custom Pod conditions for Pod readiness.

For a Pod that uses custom conditions, that Pod is evaluated to be ready **only**
when both the following statements apply:

* All containers in the Pod are ready.
* All conditions specified in `readinessGates` are `True`.

When a Pod's containers are Ready but at least one custom condition is missing or
`False`, the kubelet sets the Pod's [condition](#pod-condition) to `ContainersReady`.

## Container probes

A [Probe](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#probe-v1-core) is a diagnostic
performed periodically by the [kubelet](/docs/admin/kubelet/)
on a Container. To perform a diagnostic,
the kubelet calls a
[Handler](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#handler-v1-core) implemented by
the container. There are three types of handlers:

* [ExecAction](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#execaction-v1-core):
  Executes a specified command inside the container. The diagnostic
  is considered successful if the command exits with a status code of 0.

* [TCPSocketAction](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#tcpsocketaction-v1-core):
  Performs a TCP check against the Pod's IP address on
  a specified port. The diagnostic is considered successful if the port is open.

* [HTTPGetAction](/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/{{< param "version" >}}/#httpgetaction-v1-core):
  Performs an HTTP `GET` request against the Pod's IP
  address on a specified port and path. The diagnostic is considered successful
  if the response has a status code greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400.

Each probe has one of three results:

* `Success`: The container passed the diagnostic.
* `Failure`: The container failed the diagnostic.
* `Unknown`: The diagnostic failed, so no action should be taken.

The kubelet can optionally perform and react to three kinds of probes on running
containers:

* `livenessProbe`: Indicates whether the container is running. If
   the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container
   is subjected to its [restart policy](#restart-policy). If a Container does not
   provide a liveness probe, the default state is `Success`.

* `readinessProbe`: Indicates whether the container is ready to respond to requests.
   If the readiness probe fails, the endpoints controller removes the Pod's IP
   address from the endpoints of all Services that match the Pod. The default
   state of readiness before the initial delay is `Failure`. If a Container does
   not provide a readiness probe, the default state is `Success`.

* `startupProbe`: Indicates whether the application within the container is started.
   All other probes are disabled if a startup probe is provided, until it succeeds.
   If the startup probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container
   is subjected to its [restart policy](#restart-policy). If a Container does not
   provide a startup probe, the default state is `Success`.

For more information about how to set up a liveness, readiness, or startup probe,
see [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

### When should you use a liveness probe?

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.0" state="stable" >}}

If the process in your container is able to crash on its own whenever it
encounters an issue or becomes unhealthy, you do not necessarily need a liveness
probe; the kubelet will automatically perform the correct action in accordance
with the Pod's `restartPolicy`.

If you'd like your container to be killed and restarted if a probe fails, then
specify a liveness probe, and specify a `restartPolicy` of Always or OnFailure.

### When should you use a readiness probe?

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.0" state="stable" >}}

If you'd like to start sending traffic to a Pod only when a probe succeeds,
specify a readiness probe. In this case, the readiness probe might be the same
as the liveness probe, but the existence of the readiness probe in the spec means
that the Pod will start without receiving any traffic and only start receiving
traffic after the probe starts succeeding.
If your container needs to work on loading large data, configuration files, or
migrations during startup, specify a readiness probe.

If you want your container to be able to take itself down for maintenance, you
can specify a readiness probe that checks an endpoint specific to readiness that
is different from the liveness probe.

{{< note >}}
If you just want to be able to drain requests when the Pod is deleted, you do not
necessarily need a readiness probe; on deletion, the Pod automatically puts itself
into an unready state regardless of whether the readiness probe exists.
The Pod remains in the unready state while it waits for the containers in the Pod
to stop.
{{< /note >}}

### When should you use a startup probe?

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.16" state="alpha" >}}

Startup probes are useful for Pods that have containers that take a long time to
come into service. Rather than set a long liveness interval, you can configure
a separate configuration for probing the container as it starts up, allowing
a time longer than the liveness interval would allow.

If your container usually starts in more than
`initialDelaySeconds + failureThreshold Ã— periodSeconds`, you should specify a
startup probe that checks the same endpoint as the liveness probe. The default for
`periodSeconds` is 30s. You should then set its `failureThreshold` high enough to
allow the container to start, without changing the default values of the liveness
probe. This helps to protect against deadlocks.

## Termination of Pods {#pod-termination}

Because Pods represent processes running on nodes in the cluster, it is important to
allow those processes to gracefully terminate when they are no longer needed (rather
than being abruptly stopped with a `KILL` signal and having no chance to clean up).

The design aim is for you to be able to request deletion and know when processes
terminate, but also be able to ensure that deletes eventually complete.
When you request deletion of a Pod, the cluster records and tracks the intended grace period
before the Pod is allowed to be forcefully killed. With that forceful shutdown tracking in
place, the {{< glossary_tooltip text="kubelet" term_id="kubelet" >}} attempts graceful
shutdown.

Typically, the container runtime sends a TERM signal to the main process in each
container. Once the grace period has expired, the KILL signal is sent to any remaining
processes, and the Pod is then deleted from the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="API Server" term_id="kube-apiserver" >}}. If the kubelet or the
container runtime's management service is restarted while waiting for processes to terminate, the
cluster retries from the start including the full original grace period.

An example flow:

1. You use the `kubectl` tool to manually delete a specific Pod, with the default grace period
   (30 seconds).
1. The Pod in the API server is updated with the time beyond which the Pod is considered "dead"
   along with the grace period.  
   If you use `kubectl describe` to check on the Pod you're deleting, that Pod shows up as
   "Terminating".  
   On the node where the Pod is running: as soon as the kubelet sees that a Pod has been marked
   as terminating (a graceful shutdown duration has been set), the kubelet begins the local Pod
   shutdown process.
   1. If one of the Pod's containers has defined a `preStop`
      [hook](/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#hook-details), the kubelet
      runs that hook inside of the container. If the `preStop` hook is still running after the
      grace period expires, the kubelet requests a small, one-off grace period extension of 2
      seconds.
      {{< note >}}
      If the `preStop` hook needs longer to complete than the default grace period allows,
      you must modify `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to suit this.
      {{< /note >}}
   1. The kubelet triggers the container runtime to send a TERM signal to process 1 inside each
      container.
      {{< note >}}
      The containers in the Pod receive the TERM signal at different times and in an arbitrary
      order. If the order of shutdowns matters, consider using a `preStop` hook to synchronize.
      {{< /note >}}
1. At the same time as the kubelet is starting graceful shutdown, the control plane removes that
   shutting-down Pod from Endpoints (and, if enabled, EndpointSlice) objects where these represent
   a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="service" text="Service" >}} with a configured
   {{< glossary_tooltip text="selector" term_id="selector" >}}.
   {{< glossary_tooltip text="ReplicaSets" term_id="replica-set" >}} and other workload resources
   no longer treat the shutting-down Pod as a valid, in-service replica. Pods that shut down slowly
   cannot continue to serve traffic as load balancers (like the service proxy) remove the Pod from
   the list of endpoints as soon as the termination grace period _begins_.
1. When the grace period expires, the kubelet triggers forcible shutdown. The container runtime sends
   `SIGKILL` to any processes still running in any container in the Pod.
   The kubelet also cleans up a hidden `pause` container if that container runtime uses one.
1. The kubelet triggers forcible removal of Pod object from the API server, by setting grace period
   to 0 (immediate deletion).  
1. The API server deletes the Pod's API object, which is then no longer visible from any client.

### Forced Pod termination {#pod-termination-forced}

{{< caution >}}
Forced deletions can be potentially disruptive for some workloads and their Pods.
{{< /caution >}}

By default, all deletes are graceful within 30 seconds. The `kubectl delete` command supports
the `--grace-period=<seconds>` option which allows you to override the default and specify your
own value.

Setting the grace period to `0` forcibly and immediately deletes the Pod from the API
server. If the pod was still running on a node, that forcible deletion triggers the kubelet to
begin immediate cleanup.

{{< note >}}
You must specify an additional flag `--force` along with `--grace-period=0` in order to perform force deletions.
{{< /note >}}

When a force deletion is performed, the API server does not wait for confirmation
from the kubelet that the Pod has been terminated on the node it was running on. It
removes the Pod in the API immediately so a new Pod can be created with the same
name. On the node, Pods that are set to terminate immediately will still be given
a small grace period before being force killed.

If you need to force-delete Pods that are part of a StatefulSet, refer to the task
documentation for
[deleting Pods from a StatefulSet](/docs/tasks/run-application/force-delete-stateful-set-pod/).

### Garbage collection of failed Pods {#pod-garbage-collection}

For failed Pods, the API objects remain in the cluster's API until a human or
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="controller" text="controller" >}} process
explicitly removes them.

The control plane cleans up terminated Pods (with a phase of `Succeeded` or
`Failed`), when the number of Pods exceeds the configured threshold
(determined by `terminated-pod-gc-threshold` in the kube-controller-manager).
This avoids a resource leak as Pods are created and terminated over time.
