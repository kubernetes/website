<!-- overview -->

A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate.
As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions.  When a specified number
of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete.  Deleting a Job will clean up
the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job
is resumed again.

A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion.
The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example
due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).

You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.

If you want to run a Job (either a single task, or several in parallel) on a schedule,
see [CronJob](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).

## Running an example Job

Here is an example Job config.  It computes Ï€ to 2000 places and prints it out.
It takes around 10s to complete.

{{< codenew file="controllers/job.yaml" >}}

You can run the example with this command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/job.yaml
```

The output is similar to this:

```
job.batch/pi created
```

Check on the status of the Job with `kubectl`:

{{< tabs name="Check status of Job" >}}
{{< tab name="kubectl describe job pi" codelang="bash" >}}

To view completed Pods of a Job, use `kubectl get pods`.

To list all the Pods that belong to a Job in a machine readable form, you can use a command like this:

```shell
pods=$(kubectl get pods --selector=batch.kubernetes.io/job-name=pi --output=jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}')
echo $pods
```

The output is similar to this:

```
pi-5rwd7
```

Here, the selector is the same as the selector for the Job.  The `--output=jsonpath` option specifies an expression
with the name from each Pod in the returned list.

View the standard output of one of the pods:

```shell
kubectl logs $pods
```

Another way to view the logs of a Job:

```shell
kubectl logs jobs/pi
```

The output is similar to this:

```

```

## Writing a Job spec

As with all other Kubernetes config, a Job needs `apiVersion`, `kind`, and `metadata` fields.

When the control plane creates new Pods for a Job, the `.metadata.name` of the
Job is part of the basis for naming those Pods.  The name of a Job must be a valid
[DNS subdomain](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names)
value, but this can produce unexpected results for the Pod hostnames.  For best compatibility,
the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a
[DNS label](/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-label-names).
Even when the name is a DNS subdomain, the name must be no longer than 63
characters.

A Job also needs a [`.spec` section](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status).

### Job Labels

Job labels will have `batch.kubernetes.io/` prefix for `job-name` and `controller-uid`.

### Pod Template

The `.spec.template` is the only required field of the `.spec`.


The `.spec.template` is a [pod template](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-templates). It has exactly the same schema as a {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}}, except it is nested and does not have an `apiVersion` or `kind`.

In addition to required fields for a Pod, a pod template in a Job must specify appropriate
labels (see [pod selector](#pod-selector)) and an appropriate restart policy.

Only a [`RestartPolicy`](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy) equal to `Never` or `OnFailure` is allowed.

### Pod selector

The `.spec.selector` field is optional.  In almost all cases you should not specify it.
See section [specifying your own pod selector](#specifying-your-own-pod-selector).


### Parallel execution for Jobs {#parallel-jobs}

There are three main types of task suitable to run as a Job:

1. Non-parallel Jobs
   - normally, only one Pod is started, unless the Pod fails.
   - the Job is complete as soon as its Pod terminates successfully.
1. Parallel Jobs with a *fixed completion count*:
   - specify a non-zero positive value for `.spec.completions`.
   - the Job represents the overall task, and is complete when there are `.spec.completions` successful Pods.
   - when using `.spec.completionMode="Indexed"`, each Pod gets a different index in the range 0 to `.spec.completions-1`.
1. Parallel Jobs with a *work queue*:
   - do not specify `.spec.completions`, default to `.spec.parallelism`.
   - the Pods must coordinate amongst themselves or an external service to determine what each should work on. For example, a Pod might fetch a batch of up to N items from the work queue.
   - each Pod is independently capable of determining whether or not all its peers are done, and thus that the entire Job is done.
   - when _any_ Pod from the Job terminates with success, no new Pods are created.
   - once at least one Pod has terminated with success and all Pods are terminated, then the Job is completed with success.
   - once any Pod has exited with success, no other Pod should still be doing any work for this task or writing any output.  They should all be in the process of exiting.

For a _non-parallel_ Job, you can leave both `.spec.completions` and `.spec.parallelism` unset.  When both are
unset, both are defaulted to 1.

For a _fixed completion count_ Job, you should set `.spec.completions` to the number of completions needed.
You can set `.spec.parallelism`, or leave it unset and it will default to 1.

For a _work queue_ Job, you must leave `.spec.completions` unset, and set `.spec.parallelism` to
a non-negative integer.

For more information about how to make use of the different types of job, see the [job patterns](#job-patterns) section.

#### Controlling parallelism

The requested parallelism (`.spec.parallelism`) can be set to any non-negative value.
If it is unspecified, it defaults to 1.
If it is specified as 0, then the Job is effectively paused until it is increased.

Actual parallelism (number of pods running at any instant) may be more or less than requested
parallelism, for a variety of reasons:

- For _fixed completion count_ Jobs, the actual number of pods running in parallel will not exceed the number of
  remaining completions.   Higher values of `.spec.parallelism` are effectively ignored.
- For _work queue_ Jobs, no new Pods are started after any Pod has succeeded -- remaining Pods are allowed to complete, however.
- If the Job {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="controller" >}} has not had time to react.
- If the Job controller failed to create Pods for any reason (lack of `ResourceQuota`, lack of permission, etc.),
  then there may be fewer pods than requested.
- The Job controller may throttle new Pod creation due to excessive previous pod failures in the same Job.
- When a Pod is gracefully shut down, it takes time to stop.

### Completion mode

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

Jobs with _fixed completion count_ - that is, jobs that have non null
`.spec.completions` - can have a completion mode that is specified in `.spec.completionMode`:

- `NonIndexed` (default): the Job is considered complete when there have been
  `.spec.completions` successfully completed Pods. In other words, each Pod
  completion is homologous to each other. Note that Jobs that have null
  `.spec.completions` are implicitly `NonIndexed`.
- `Indexed`: the Pods of a Job get an associated completion index from 0 to
  `.spec.completions-1`. The index is available through three mechanisms:
  - The Pod annotation `batch.kubernetes.io/job-completion-index`.
  - As part of the Pod hostname, following the pattern `$(job-name)-$(index)`.
    When you use an Indexed Job in combination with a
    {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="Service" >}}, Pods within the Job can use
    the deterministic hostnames to address each other via DNS. For more information about
    how to configure this, see [Job with Pod-to-Pod Communication](/docs/tasks/job/job-with-pod-to-pod-communication/).
  - From the containerized task, in the environment variable `JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX`.
  
  The Job is considered complete when there is one successfully completed Pod
  for each index. For more information about how to use this mode, see
  [Indexed Job for Parallel Processing with Static Work Assignment](/docs/tasks/job/indexed-parallel-processing-static/).

{{< note >}}
Although rare, more than one Pod could be started for the same index (due to various reasons such as node failures,
kubelet restarts, or Pod evictions). In this case, only the first Pod that completes successfully will
count towards the completion count and update the status of the Job. The other Pods that are running
or completed for the same index will be deleted by the Job controller once they are detected.

## Handling Pod and container failures

A container in a Pod may fail for a number of reasons, such as because the process in it exited with
a non-zero exit code, or the container was killed for exceeding a memory limit, etc.  If this
happens, and the `.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "OnFailure"`, then the Pod stays
on the node, but the container is re-run.  Therefore, your program needs to handle the case when it is
restarted locally, or else specify `.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"`.
See [pod lifecycle](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#example-states) for more information on `restartPolicy`.

An entire Pod can also fail, for a number of reasons, such as when the pod is kicked off the node
(node is upgraded, rebooted, deleted, etc.), or if a container of the Pod fails and the
`.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"`.  When a Pod fails, then the Job controller
starts a new Pod.  This means that your application needs to handle the case when it is restarted in a new
pod.  In particular, it needs to handle temporary files, locks, incomplete output and the like
caused by previous runs.

By default, each pod failure is counted towards the `.spec.backoffLimit` limit,
see [pod backoff failure policy](#pod-backoff-failure-policy). However, you can
customize handling of pod failures by setting the Job's [pod failure policy](#pod-failure-policy).

Note that even if you specify `.spec.parallelism = 1` and `.spec.completions = 1` and
`.spec.template.spec.restartPolicy = "Never"`, the same program may
sometimes be started twice.

If you do specify `.spec.parallelism` and `.spec.completions` both greater than 1, then there may be
multiple pods running at once.  Therefore, your pods must also be tolerant of concurrency.

When the [feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
`PodDisruptionConditions` and `JobPodFailurePolicy` are both enabled,
and the `.spec.podFailurePolicy` field is set, the Job controller does not consider a terminating
Pod (a pod that has a `.metadata.deletionTimestamp` field set) as a failure until that Pod is
terminal (its `.status.phase` is `Failed` or `Succeeded`). However, the Job controller
creates a replacement Pod as soon as the termination becomes apparent. Once the
pod terminates, the Job controller evaluates `.backoffLimit` and `.podFailurePolicy`
for the relevant Job, taking this now-terminated Pod into consideration.

If either of these requirements is not satisfied, the Job controller counts
a terminating Pod as an immediate failure, even if that Pod later terminates
with `phase: "Succeeded"`.

### Pod backoff failure policy

There are situations where you want to fail a Job after some amount of retries
due to a logical error in configuration etc.
To do so, set `.spec.backoffLimit` to specify the number of retries before
considering a Job as failed. The back-off limit is set by default to 6. Failed
Pods associated with the Job are recreated by the Job controller with an
exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s ...) capped at six minutes.

The number of retries is calculated in two ways:
- The number of Pods with `.status.phase = "Failed"`.
- When using `restartPolicy = "OnFailure"`, the number of retries in all the
  containers of Pods with `.status.phase` equal to `Pending` or `Running`.

If either of the calculations reaches the `.spec.backoffLimit`, the Job is
considered failed.

{{< note >}}
If your job has `restartPolicy = "OnFailure"`, keep in mind that your Pod running the Job
will be terminated once the job backoff limit has been reached. This can make debugging the Job's executable more difficult. We suggest setting
`restartPolicy = "Never"` when debugging the Job or using a logging system to ensure output
from failed Jobs is not lost inadvertently.
{{< /note >}}

### Pod failure policy {#pod-failure-policy}

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="beta" >}}

{{< note >}}
You can only configure a Pod failure policy for a Job if you have the
`JobPodFailurePolicy` [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
enabled in your cluster. Additionally, it is recommended
to enable the `PodDisruptionConditions` feature gate in order to be able to detect and handle
Pod disruption conditions in the Pod failure policy (see also:
[Pod disruption conditions](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions#pod-disruption-conditions)). Both feature gates are
available in Kubernetes {{< skew currentVersion >}}.
{{< /note >}}

A Pod failure policy, defined with the `.spec.podFailurePolicy` field, enables
your cluster to handle Pod failures based on the container exit codes and the
Pod conditions.

In some situations, you  may want to have a better control when handling Pod
failures than the control provided by the [Pod backoff failure policy](#pod-backoff-failure-policy),
which is based on the Job's `.spec.backoffLimit`. These are some examples of use cases:
* To optimize costs of running workloads by avoiding unnecessary Pod restarts,
  you can terminate a Job as soon as one of its Pods fails with an exit code
  indicating a software bug.
* To guarantee that your Job finishes even if there are disruptions, you can
  ignore Pod failures caused by disruptions  (such {{< glossary_tooltip text="preemption" term_id="preemption" >}},
  {{< glossary_tooltip text="API-initiated eviction" term_id="api-eviction" >}}
  or {{< glossary_tooltip text="taint" term_id="taint" >}}-based eviction) so
  that they don't count towards the `.spec.backoffLimit` limit of retries.

You can configure a Pod failure policy, in the `.spec.podFailurePolicy` field,
to meet the above use cases. This policy can handle Pod failures based on the
container exit codes and the Pod conditions.

Here is a manifest for a Job that defines a `podFailurePolicy`:

{{< codenew file="/controllers/job-pod-failure-policy-example.yaml" >}}

In the example above, the first rule of the Pod failure policy specifies that
the Job should be marked failed if the `main` container fails with the 42 exit
code. The following are the rules for the `main` container specifically:

- an exit code of 0 means that the container succeeded
- an exit code of 42 means that the **entire Job** failed
- any other exit code represents that the container failed, and hence the entire
  Pod. The Pod will be re-created if the total number of restarts is
  below `backoffLimit`. If the `backoffLimit` is reached the **entire Job** failed.

{{< note >}}
Because the Pod template specifies a `restartPolicy: Never`,
the kubelet does not restart the `main` container in that particular Pod.
{{< /note >}}

The second rule of the Pod failure policy, specifying the `Ignore` action for
failed Pods with condition `DisruptionTarget` excludes Pod disruptions from
being counted towards the `.spec.backoffLimit` limit of retries.

{{< note >}}
If the Job failed, either by the Pod failure policy or Pod backoff
failure policy, and the Job is running multiple Pods, Kubernetes terminates all
the Pods in that Job that are still Pending or Running.
{{< /note >}}

These are some requirements and semantics of the API:
- if you want to use a `.spec.podFailurePolicy` field for a Job, you must
  also define that Job's pod template with `.spec.restartPolicy` set to `Never`.
- the Pod failure policy rules you specify under `spec.podFailurePolicy.rules`
  are evaluated in order. Once a rule matches a Pod failure, the remaining rules
  are ignored. When no rule matches the Pod failure, the default
  handling applies.
- you may want to restrict a rule to a specific container by specifying its name
  in`spec.podFailurePolicy.rules[*].containerName`. When not specified the rule
  applies to all containers. When specified, it should match one the container
  or `initContainer` names in the Pod template.
- you may specify the action taken when a Pod failure policy is matched by
  `spec.podFailurePolicy.rules[*].action`. Possible values are:
  - `FailJob`: use to indicate that the Pod's job should be marked as Failed and
     all running Pods should be terminated.
  - `Ignore`: use to indicate that the counter towards the `.spec.backoffLimit`
     should not be incremented and a replacement Pod should be created.
  - `Count`: use to indicate that the Pod should be handled in the default way.
     The counter towards the `.spec.backoffLimit` should be incremented.

When you use a `podFailurePolicy`, the job controller only matches Pods in the
`Failed` phase. Pods with a deletion timestamp that are not in a terminal phase
(`Failed` or `Succeeded`) are considered still terminating. This implies that
terminating pods retain a [tracking finalizer](#job-tracking-with-finalizers)
until they reach a terminal phase.
Since Kubernetes 1.27, Kubelet transitions deleted pods to a terminal phase
(see: [Pod Phase](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-phase)). This
ensures that deleted pods have their finalizers removed by the Job controller.
{{< /note >}}

## Job termination and cleanup

When a Job completes, no more Pods are created, but the Pods are [usually](#pod-backoff-failure-policy) not deleted either.
Keeping them around
allows you to still view the logs of completed pods to check for errors, warnings, or other diagnostic output.
The job object also remains after it is completed so that you can view its status.  It is up to the user to delete
old jobs after noting their status.  Delete the job with `kubectl` (e.g. `kubectl delete jobs/pi` or `kubectl delete -f ./job.yaml`). When you delete the job using `kubectl`, all the pods it created are deleted too.

By default, a Job will run uninterrupted unless a Pod fails (`restartPolicy=Never`) or a Container exits in error (`restartPolicy=OnFailure`), at which point the Job defers to the
`.spec.backoffLimit` described above. Once `.spec.backoffLimit` has been reached the Job will be marked as failed and any running Pods will be terminated.

Another way to terminate a Job is by setting an active deadline.
Do this by setting the `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` field of the Job to a number of seconds.
The `activeDeadlineSeconds` applies to the duration of the job, no matter how many Pods are created.
Once a Job reaches `activeDeadlineSeconds`, all of its running Pods are terminated and the Job status will become `type: Failed` with `reason: DeadlineExceeded`.

Note that a Job's `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` takes precedence over its `.spec.backoffLimit`. Therefore, a Job that is retrying one or more failed Pods will not deploy additional Pods once it reaches the time limit specified by `activeDeadlineSeconds`, even if the `backoffLimit` is not yet reached.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi-with-timeout
spec:
  backoffLimit: 5
  activeDeadlineSeconds: 100
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

Note that both the Job spec and the [Pod template spec](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/#detailed-behavior) within the Job have an `activeDeadlineSeconds` field. Ensure that you set this field at the proper level.

Keep in mind that the `restartPolicy` applies to the Pod, and not to the Job itself: there is no automatic Job restart once the Job status is `type: Failed`.
That is, the Job termination mechanisms activated with `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` and `.spec.backoffLimit` result in a permanent Job failure that requires manual intervention to resolve.

## Clean up finished jobs automatically

Finished Jobs are usually no longer needed in the system. Keeping them around in
the system will put pressure on the API server. If the Jobs are managed directly
by a higher level controller, such as
[CronJobs](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/), the Jobs can be
cleaned up by CronJobs based on the specified capacity-based cleanup policy.

### TTL mechanism for finished Jobs

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.23" state="stable" >}}

Another way to clean up finished Jobs (either `Complete` or `Failed`)
automatically is to use a TTL mechanism provided by a
[TTL controller](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/ttlafterfinished/) for
finished resources, by specifying the `.spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` field of
the Job.

When the TTL controller cleans up the Job, it will delete the Job cascadingly,
i.e. delete its dependent objects, such as Pods, together with the Job. Note
that when the Job is deleted, its lifecycle guarantees, such as finalizers, will
be honored.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi-with-ttl
spec:
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl:5.34.0
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```

The Job `pi-with-ttl` will be eligible to be automatically deleted, `100`
seconds after it finishes.

If the field is set to `0`, the Job will be eligible to be automatically deleted
immediately after it finishes. If the field is unset, this Job won't be cleaned
up by the TTL controller after it finishes.

{{< note >}}
It is recommended to set `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` field because unmanaged jobs
(Jobs that you created directly, and not indirectly through other workload APIs
such as CronJob) have a default deletion
policy of `orphanDependents` causing Pods created by an unmanaged Job to be left around
after that Job is fully deleted.
Even though the {{< glossary_tooltip text="control plane" term_id="control-plane" >}} eventually
[garbage collects](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-garbage-collection)
the Pods from a deleted Job after they either fail or complete, sometimes those
lingering pods may cause cluster performance degradation or in worst case cause the
cluster to go offline due to this degradation.

You can use [LimitRanges](/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/) and
[ResourceQuotas](/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/) to place a
cap on the amount of resources that a particular namespace can
consume.

## Job patterns

The Job object can be used to support reliable parallel execution of Pods.  The Job object is not
designed to support closely-communicating parallel processes, as commonly found in scientific
computing.  It does support parallel processing of a set of independent but related *work items*.
These might be emails to be sent, frames to be rendered, files to be transcoded, ranges of keys in a
NoSQL database to scan, and so on.

In a complex system, there may be multiple different sets of work items.  Here we are just
considering one set of work items that the user wants to manage together &mdash; a *batch job*.

There are several different patterns for parallel computation, each with strengths and weaknesses.
The tradeoffs are:

- One Job object for each work item, vs. a single Job object for all work items.  The latter is
  better for large numbers of work items.  The former creates some overhead for the user and for the
  system to manage large numbers of Job objects.
- Number of pods created equals number of work items, vs. each Pod can process multiple work items.
  The former typically requires less modification to existing code and containers.  The latter
  is better for large numbers of work items, for similar reasons to the previous bullet.
- Several approaches use a work queue.  This requires running a queue service,
  and modifications to the existing program or container to make it use the work queue.
  Other approaches are easier to adapt to an existing containerised application.


The tradeoffs are summarized here, with columns 2 to 4 corresponding to the above tradeoffs.
The pattern names are also links to examples and more detailed description.

|                  Pattern                        | Single Job object | Fewer pods than work items? | Use app unmodified? |
| ----------------------------------------------- |:-----------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------------:|
| [Queue with Pod Per Work Item]                  |         âœ“         |                             |      sometimes      |
| [Queue with Variable Pod Count]                 |         âœ“         |             âœ“               |                     |

| [Job Template Expansion]                        |                   |                             |          âœ“          |

When you specify completions with `.spec.completions`, each Pod created by the Job controller
has an identical [`spec`](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status).  This means that
all pods for a task will have the same command line and the same
image, the same volumes, and (almost) the same environment variables.  These patterns
are different ways to arrange for pods to work on different things.

This table shows the required settings for `.spec.parallelism` and `.spec.completions` for each of the patterns.
Here, `W` is the number of work items.

|             Pattern                             | `.spec.completions` |  `.spec.parallelism` |

## Advanced usage

### Suspending a Job

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.24" state="stable" >}}

When a Job is created, the Job controller will immediately begin creating Pods
to satisfy the Job's requirements and will continue to do so until the Job is
complete. However, you may want to temporarily suspend a Job's execution and
resume it later, or start Jobs in suspended state and have a custom controller
decide later when to start them.

To suspend a Job, you can update the `.spec.suspend` field of
the Job to true; later, when you want to resume it again, update it to false.
Creating a Job with `.spec.suspend` set to true will create it in the suspended
state.

When a Job is resumed from suspension, its `.status.startTime` field will be
reset to the current time. This means that the `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`
timer will be stopped and reset when a Job is suspended and resumed.

When you suspend a Job, any running Pods that don't have a status of `Completed` will be [terminated](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination).
with a SIGTERM signal. The Pod's graceful termination period will be honored and
your Pod must handle this signal in this period. This may involve saving
progress for later or undoing changes. Pods terminated this way will not count
towards the Job's `completions` count.

An example Job definition in the suspended state can be like so:

```shell
kubectl get job myjob -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: myjob
spec:
  suspend: true
  parallelism: 1
  completions: 5
  template:
    spec:
      ...
```

You can also toggle Job suspension by patching the Job using the command line.

Suspend an active Job:

```shell
kubectl patch job/myjob --type=strategic --patch '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
```

Resume a suspended Job:

```shell
kubectl patch job/myjob --type=strategic --patch '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
```

The Job's status can be used to determine if a Job is suspended or has been
suspended in the past:

```shell
kubectl get jobs/myjob -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
# .metadata and .spec omitted
status:
  conditions:
  - lastProbeTime: "2021-02-05T13:14:33Z"
    lastTransitionTime: "2021-02-05T13:14:33Z"
    status: "True"
    type: Suspended
  startTime: "2021-02-05T13:13:48Z"
```

The Job condition of type "Suspended" with status "True" means the Job is
suspended; the `lastTransitionTime` field can be used to determine how long the
Job has been suspended for. If the status of that condition is "False", then the
Job was previously suspended and is now running. If such a condition does not
exist in the Job's status, the Job has never been stopped.

Events are also created when the Job is suspended and resumed:

```shell
kubectl describe jobs/myjob
```

```
Name:           myjob
...
Events:
  Type    Reason            Age   From            Message
  ----    ------            ----  ----            -------
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  12m   job-controller  Created pod: myjob-hlrpl
  Normal  SuccessfulDelete  11m   job-controller  Deleted pod: myjob-hlrpl
  Normal  Suspended         11m   job-controller  Job suspended
  Normal  SuccessfulCreate  3s    job-controller  Created pod: myjob-jvb44
  Normal  Resumed           3s    job-controller  Job resumed
```

The last four events, particularly the "Suspended" and "Resumed" events, are
directly a result of toggling the `.spec.suspend` field. In the time between
these two events, we see that no Pods were created, but Pod creation restarted
as soon as the Job was resumed.

### Mutable Scheduling Directives

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.27" state="stable" >}}

In most cases a parallel job will want the pods to run with constraints, 
like all in the same zone, or all either on GPU model x or y but not a mix of both.

The [suspend](#suspending-a-job) field is the first step towards achieving those semantics. Suspend allows a 
custom queue controller to decide when a job should start; However, once a job is unsuspended,
a custom queue controller has no influence on where the pods of a job will actually land.

This feature allows updating a Job's scheduling directives before it starts, which gives custom queue
controllers the ability to influence pod placement while at the same time offloading actual 
pod-to-node assignment to kube-scheduler. This is allowed only for suspended Jobs that have never 
been unsuspended before.

The fields in a Job's pod template that can be updated are node affinity, node selector, 
tolerations, labels, annotations and [scheduling gates](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-scheduling-readiness/).

### Specifying your own Pod selector

Normally, when you create a Job object, you do not specify `.spec.selector`.
The system defaulting logic adds this field when the Job is created.
It picks a selector value that will not overlap with any other jobs.

However, in some cases, you might need to override this automatically set selector.
To do this, you can specify the `.spec.selector` of the Job.

Be very careful when doing this.  If you specify a label selector which is not
unique to the pods of that Job, and which matches unrelated Pods, then pods of the unrelated
job may be deleted, or this Job may count other Pods as completing it, or one or both
Jobs may refuse to create Pods or run to completion.  If a non-unique selector is
chosen, then other controllers (e.g. ReplicationController) and their Pods may behave
in unpredictable ways too.  Kubernetes will not stop you from making a mistake when
specifying `.spec.selector`.

Here is an example of a case when you might want to use this feature.

Say Job `old` is already running.  You want existing Pods
to keep running, but you want the rest of the Pods it creates
to use a different pod template and for the Job to have a new name.
You cannot update the Job because these fields are not updatable.
Therefore, you delete Job `old` but _leave its pods
running_, using `kubectl delete jobs/old --cascade=orphan`.
Before deleting it, you make a note of what selector it uses:

```shell
kubectl get job old -o yaml
```

The output is similar to this:

```yaml
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: old
  ...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      batch.kubernetes.io/controller-uid: a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002
  ...
```

Then you create a new Job with name `new` and you explicitly specify the same selector.
Since the existing Pods have label `batch.kubernetes.io/controller-uid=a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002`,
they are controlled by Job `new` as well.

You need to specify `manualSelector: true` in the new Job since you are not using
the selector that the system normally generates for you automatically.

```yaml
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: new
  ...
spec:
  manualSelector: true
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      batch.kubernetes.io/controller-uid: a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002
  ...
```

The new Job itself will have a different uid from `a8f3d00d-c6d2-11e5-9f87-42010af00002`.  Setting
`manualSelector: true` tells the system that you know what you are doing and to allow this
mismatch.

### Job tracking with finalizers

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.26" state="stable" >}}

{{< note >}}
The control plane doesn't track Jobs using finalizers, if the Jobs were created
when the feature gate `JobTrackingWithFinalizers` was disabled, even after you
upgrade the control plane to 1.26.
{{< /note >}}

The control plane keeps track of the Pods that belong to any Job and notices if
any such Pod is removed from the API server. To do that, the Job controller
creates Pods with the finalizer `batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`. The
controller removes the finalizer only after the Pod has been accounted for in
the Job status, allowing the Pod to be removed by other controllers or users.

Jobs created before upgrading to Kubernetes 1.26 or before the feature gate
`JobTrackingWithFinalizers` is enabled are tracked without the use of Pod
finalizers.
The Job {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="controller" text="controller" >}} updates
the status counters for `succeeded` and `failed` Pods based only on the Pods
that exist in the cluster. The contol plane can lose track of the progress of
the Job if Pods are deleted from the cluster.

You can determine if the control plane is tracking a Job using Pod finalizers by
checking if the Job has the annotation
`batch.kubernetes.io/job-tracking`. You should **not** manually add or remove
this annotation from Jobs. Instead, you can recreate the Jobs to ensure they
are tracked using Pod finalizers.

### Elastic Indexed Jobs

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.27" state="beta" >}}

You can scale Indexed Jobs up or down by mutating both `.spec.parallelism` 
and `.spec.completions` together such that `.spec.parallelism == .spec.completions`. 
When the `ElasticIndexedJob`[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
on the [API server](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/)
is disabled, `.spec.completions` is immutable.

Use cases for elastic Indexed Jobs include batch workloads which require 
scaling an indexed Job, such as MPI, Horovord, Ray, and PyTorch training jobs.

## Alternatives

### Bare Pods

When the node that a Pod is running on reboots or fails, the pod is terminated
and will not be restarted.  However, a Job will create new Pods to replace terminated ones.
For this reason, we recommend that you use a Job rather than a bare Pod, even if your application
requires only a single Pod.

### Replication Controller

Jobs are complementary to [Replication Controllers](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/).
A Replication Controller manages Pods which are not expected to terminate (e.g. web servers), and a Job
manages Pods that are expected to terminate (e.g. batch tasks).

As discussed in [Pod Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/), `Job` is *only* appropriate
for pods with `RestartPolicy` equal to `OnFailure` or `Never`.
(Note: If `RestartPolicy` is not set, the default value is `Always`.)

### Single Job starts controller Pod

Another pattern is for a single Job to create a Pod which then creates other Pods, acting as a sort
of custom controller for those Pods.  This allows the most flexibility, but may be somewhat
complicated to get started with and offers less integration with Kubernetes.

One example of this pattern would be a Job which starts a Pod which runs a script that in turn
starts a Spark master controller (see [spark example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/spark/README.md)), runs a spark
driver, and then cleans up.

An advantage of this approach is that the overall process gets the completion guarantee of a Job
object, but maintains complete control over what Pods are created and how work is assigned to them.
