## What are service accounts? {#what-are-service-accounts}

A service account is a type of non-human account that, in Kubernetes, provides
a distinct identity in a Kubernetes cluster. Application Pods, system
components, and entities inside and outside the cluster can use a specific
ServiceAccount's credentials to identify as that ServiceAccount. This identity
is useful in various situations, including authenticating to the API server or
implementing identity-based security policies.

Service accounts exist as ServiceAccount objects in the API server. Service
accounts have the following properties:

*  **Namespaced:** Each service account is bound to a Kubernetes
   {{<glossary_tooltip text="namespace" term_id="namespace">}}. Every namespace
   gets a [`default` ServiceAccount](#default-service-accounts) upon creation.

*  **Lightweight:** Service accounts exist in the cluster and are
   defined in the Kubernetes API. You can quickly create service accounts to
   enable specific tasks.

*  **Portable:** A configuration bundle for a complex containerized workload
   might include service account definitions for the system's components. The
   lightweight nature of service accounts and the namespaced identities make
   the configurations portable.

Service accounts are different from user accounts, which are authenticated
human users in the cluster. By default, user accounts don't exist in the Kubernetes
API server; instead, the API server treats user identities as opaque
data. You can authenticate as a user account using multiple methods. Some
Kubernetes distributions might add custom extension APIs to represent user
accounts in the API server.

### Default service accounts {#default-service-accounts}

When you create a cluster, Kubernetes automatically creates a ServiceAccount
object named `default` for every namespace in your cluster. The `default`
service accounts in each namespace get no permissions by default other than the
[default API discovery permissions](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#default-roles-and-role-bindings)
that Kubernetes grants to all authenticated principals if role-based access control (RBAC) is enabled.
If you delete the `default` ServiceAccount object in a namespace, the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="control plane" term_id="control-plane" >}}
replaces it with a new one.

If you deploy a Pod in a namespace, and you don't
[manually assign a ServiceAccount to the Pod](#assign-to-pod), Kubernetes
assigns the `default` ServiceAccount for that namespace to the Pod.

## Use cases for Kubernetes service accounts {#use-cases}

As a general guideline, you can use service accounts to provide identities in
the following scenarios:

* Your Pods need to communicate with the Kubernetes API server, for example in
  situations such as the following:
  *  Providing read-only access to sensitive information stored in Secrets.
  *  Granting [cross-namespace access](#cross-namespace), such as allowing a
     Pod in namespace `example` to read, list, and watch for Lease objects in
     the `kube-node-lease` namespace.
* Your Pods need to communicate with an external service. For example, a
  workload Pod requires an identity for a commercially available cloud API,
  and the commercial provider allows configuring a suitable trust relationship.
* [Authenticating to a private image registry using an `imagePullSecret`](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#add-imagepullsecrets-to-a-service-account).
* An external service needs to communicate with the Kubernetes API server. For
  example, authenticating to the cluster as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
* You use third-party security software in your cluster that relies on the
  ServiceAccount identity of different Pods to group those Pods into different
  contexts.


## How to use service accounts {#how-to-use}

To use a Kubernetes service account, you do the following:

1. Create a ServiceAccount object using a Kubernetes
   client like `kubectl` or a manifest that defines the object.
1. Grant permissions to the ServiceAccount object using an authorization
   mechanism such as
   [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
1. Assign the ServiceAccount object to Pods during Pod creation.
   
   If you're using the identity from an external service,
   [retrieve the ServiceAccount token](#get-a-token) and use it from that
   service instead.

For instructions, refer to
[Configure Service Accounts for Pods](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/).

### Grant permissions to a ServiceAccount {#grant-permissions}

You can use the built-in Kubernetes
[role-based access control (RBAC)](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
mechanism to grant the minimum permissions required by each service account.
You create a *role*, which grants access, and then *bind* the role to your
ServiceAccount. RBAC lets you define a minimum set of permissions so that the
service account permissions follow the principle of least privilege. Pods that
use that service account don't get more permissions than are required to
function correctly.

For instructions, refer to
[ServiceAccount permissions](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#service-account-permissions).

#### Cross-namespace access using a ServiceAccount {#cross-namespace}

You can use RBAC to allow service accounts in one namespace to perform actions
on resources in a different namespace in the cluster. For example, consider a
scenario where you have a service account and Pod in the `dev` namespace and
you want your Pod to see Jobs running in the `maintenance` namespace. You could
create a Role object that grants permissions to list Job objects. Then,
you'd create a RoleBinding object in the `maintenance` namespace to bind the
Role to the ServiceAccount object. Now, Pods in the `dev` namespace can list
Job objects in the `maintenance` namespace using that service account.

### Assign a ServiceAccount to a Pod {#assign-to-pod}

To assign a ServiceAccount to a Pod, you set the `spec.serviceAccountName`
field in the Pod specification. Kubernetes then automatically provides the
credentials for that ServiceAccount to the Pod. In v1.22 and later, Kubernetes
gets a short-lived, **automatically rotating** token using the `TokenRequest`
API and mounts the token as a
[projected volume](/docs/concepts/storage/projected-volumes/#serviceaccounttoken).

By default, Kubernetes provides the Pod
with the credentials for an assigned ServiceAccount, whether that is the
`default` ServiceAccount or a custom ServiceAccount that you specify. 

To prevent Kubernetes from automatically injecting
credentials for a specified ServiceAccount or the `default` ServiceAccount, set the
`automountServiceAccountToken` field in your Pod specification to `false`.

<!-- OK to remove this historical detail after Kubernetes 1.31 is released -->

In versions earlier than 1.22, Kubernetes provides a long-lived, static token
to the Pod as a Secret.

#### Manually retrieve ServiceAccount credentials {#get-a-token}

If you need the credentials for a ServiceAccount to mount in a non-standard
location, or for an audience that isn't the API server, use one of the
following methods:

* [TokenRequest API](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-request-v1/)
  (recommended): Request a short-lived service account token from within
  your own *application code*. The token expires automatically and can rotate
  upon expiration.
  If you have a legacy application that is not aware of Kubernetes, you
  could use a sidecar container within the same pod to fetch these tokens
  and make them available to the application workload.
* [Token Volume Projection](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#serviceaccount-token-volume-projection)
  (also recommended): In Kubernetes v1.20 and later, use the Pod specification to
  tell the kubelet to add the service account token to the Pod as a
  *projected volume*. Projected tokens expire automatically, and the kubelet
  rotates the token before it expires.
* [Service Account Token Secrets](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#manually-create-an-api-token-for-a-serviceaccount)
  (not recommended): You can mount service account tokens as Kubernetes
  Secrets in Pods. These tokens don't expire and don't rotate.
  This method is not recommended, especially at scale, because of the risks associated
  with static, long-lived credentials. In Kubernetes v1.24 and later, the
  [LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-gates-for-graduated-or-deprecated-features)
  prevents Kubernetes from automatically creating these tokens for
  ServiceAccounts. `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` is enabled
  by default; in other words, Kubernetes does not create these tokens.

{{< note >}}
For applications running outside your Kubernetes cluster, you might be considering
creating a long-lived ServiceAccount token that is stored in a Secret. This allows authentication, but the Kubernetes project recommends you avoid this approach.
Long-lived bearer tokens represent a security risk as, once disclosed, the token
can be misused. Instead, consider using an alternative. For example, your external
application can authenticate using a well-protected private key `and` a certificate,
or using a custom mechanism such as an [authentication webhook](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#webhook-token-authentication) that you implement yourself.

You can also use TokenRequest to obtain short-lived tokens for your external application.

## Authenticating service account credentials {#authenticating-credentials}

ServiceAccounts use signed
{{<glossary_tooltip term_id="jwt" text="JSON Web Tokens">}}  (JWTs)
to authenticate to the Kubernetes API server, and to any other system where a
trust relationship exists. Depending on how the token was issued
(either time-limited using a `TokenRequest` or using a legacy mechanism with
a Secret), a ServiceAccount token might also have an expiry time, an audience,
and a time after which the token *starts* being valid. When a client that is
acting as a ServiceAccount tries to communicate with the Kubernetes API server,
the client includes an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header with the HTTP
request. The API server checks the validity of that bearer token as follows:

1. Check the token signature.
1. Check whether the token has expired.
1. Check whether object references in the token claims are currently valid.
1. Check whether the token is currently valid.
1. Check the audience claims.

The TokenRequest API produces _bound tokens_ for a ServiceAccount. This
binding is linked to the lifetime of the client, such as a Pod, that is acting
as that ServiceAccount.

For tokens issued using the `TokenRequest` API, the API server also checks that
the specific object reference that is using the ServiceAccount still exists,
matching by the {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="uid" text="unique ID" >}} of that
object. For legacy tokens that are mounted as Secrets in Pods, the API server
checks the token against the Secret.

For more information about the authentication process, refer to
[Authentication](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens).

### Authenticating service account credentials in your own code {#authenticating-in-code}

If you have services of your own that need to validate Kubernetes service
account credentials, you can use the following methods:

* [TokenReview API](/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-review-v1/)
  (recommended)
* OIDC discovery

The Kubernetes project recommends that you use the TokenReview API, because
this method invalidates tokens that are bound to API objects such as Secrets,
ServiceAccounts, and Pods when those objects are deleted. For example, if you
delete the Pod that contains a projected ServiceAccount token, the cluster
invalidates that token immediately and a TokenReview immediately fails.
If you use OIDC validation instead, your clients continue to treat the token
as valid until the token reaches its expiration timestamp.

Your application should always define the audience that it accepts, and should
check that the token's audiences match the audiences that the application
expects. This helps to minimize the scope of the token so that it can only be
used in your application and nowhere else.

## Alternatives

* Issue your own tokens using another mechanism, and then use
  [Webhook Token Authentication](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#webhook-token-authentication)
  to validate bearer tokens using your own validation service.
* Provide your own identities to Pods.
    * [Use the SPIFFE CSI driver plugin to provide SPIFFE SVIDs as X.509 certificate pairs to Pods](https://cert-manager.io/docs/projects/csi-driver-spiffe/).
    {{% thirdparty-content single="true" %}}
    * [Use a service mesh such as Istio to provide certificates to Pods](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/cert-management/plugin-ca-cert/).
* Authenticate from outside the cluster to the API server without using service account tokens:
    * [Configure the API server to accept OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens from your identity provider](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens).
    * Use service accounts or user accounts created using an external Identity
      and Access Management (IAM) service, such as from a cloud provider, to
      authenticate to your cluster.
    * [Use the CertificateSigningRequest API with client certificates](/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/).
* [Configure the kubelet to retrieve credentials from an image registry](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubelet-credential-provider/).
* Use a Device Plugin to access a virtual Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which
  then allows authentication using a private key.
