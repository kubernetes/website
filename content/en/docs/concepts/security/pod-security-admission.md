<!-- overview -->

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.25" state="stable" >}}

The Kubernetes [Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) define
different isolation levels for Pods. These standards let you define how you want to restrict the
behavior of pods in a clear, consistent fashion.

Kubernetes offers a built-in _Pod Security_ {{< glossary_tooltip text="admission controller"
term_id="admission-controller" >}} to enforce the Pod Security Standards. Pod security restrictions
are applied at the {{< glossary_tooltip text="namespace" term_id="namespace" >}} level when pods are
created.

### Built-in Pod Security admission enforcement

This page is part of the documentation for Kubernetes v{{< skew currentVersion >}}.
If you are running a different version of Kubernetes, consult the documentation for that release.

<!-- body -->

## Pod Security levels

Pod Security admission places requirements on a Pod's [Security
Context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) and other related fields according
to the three levels defined by the [Pod Security
Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards): `privileged`, `baseline`, and
`restricted`. Refer to the [Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards)
page for an in-depth look at those requirements.

## Pod Security Admission labels for namespaces

Once the feature is enabled or the webhook is installed, you can configure namespaces to define the admission
control mode you want to use for pod security in each namespace. Kubernetes defines a set of 
{{< glossary_tooltip term_id="label" text="labels" >}} that you can set to define which of the 
predefined Pod Security Standard levels you want to use for a namespace. The label you select
defines what action the {{< glossary_tooltip text="control plane" term_id="control-plane" >}}
takes if a potential violation is detected:

{{< table caption="Pod Security Admission modes" >}}
Mode | Description
:---------|:------------
**enforce** | Policy violations will cause the pod to be rejected.
**audit** | Policy violations will trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the [audit log](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/), but are otherwise allowed.
**warn** | Policy violations will trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.
{{< /table >}}

A namespace can configure any or all modes, or even set a different level for different modes.

For each mode, there are two labels that determine the policy used:

```yaml
# The per-mode level label indicates which policy level to apply for the mode.
#
# MODE must be one of `enforce`, `audit`, or `warn`.
# LEVEL must be one of `privileged`, `baseline`, or `restricted`.
pod-security.kubernetes.io/<MODE>: <LEVEL>

# Optional: per-mode version label that can be used to pin the policy to the
# version that shipped with a given Kubernetes minor version (for example v{{< skew currentVersion >}}).
#
# MODE must be one of `enforce`, `audit`, or `warn`.
# VERSION must be a valid Kubernetes minor version, or `latest`.
pod-security.kubernetes.io/<MODE>-version: <VERSION>
```

Check out [Enforce Pod Security Standards with Namespace Labels](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/enforce-standards-namespace-labels) to see example usage.

## Workload resources and Pod templates

Pods are often created indirectly, by creating a [workload
object](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/) such as a {{< glossary_tooltip
term_id="deployment" >}} or {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="job">}}. The workload object defines a
_Pod template_ and a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="controller" text="controller" >}} for the
workload resource creates Pods based on that template. To help catch violations early, both the
audit and warning modes are applied to the workload resources. However, enforce mode is **not**
applied to workload resources, only to the resulting pod objects.

## Exemptions

You can define _exemptions_ from pod security enforcement in order to allow the creation of pods that
would have otherwise been prohibited due to the policy associated with a given namespace.
Exemptions can be statically configured in the
[Admission Controller configuration](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/enforce-standards-admission-controller/#configure-the-admission-controller).

Exemptions must be explicitly enumerated. Requests meeting exemption criteria are _ignored_ by the
Admission Controller (all `enforce`, `audit` and `warn` behaviors are skipped). Exemption dimensions include:

- **Usernames:** requests from users with an exempt authenticated (or impersonated) username are
  ignored.
- **RuntimeClassNames:** pods and [workload resources](#workload-resources-and-pod-templates) specifying an exempt runtime class name are
  ignored.
- **Namespaces:** pods and [workload resources](#workload-resources-and-pod-templates) in an exempt namespace are ignored.

{{< caution >}}

Most pods are created by a controller in response to a [workload
resource](#workload-resources-and-pod-templates), meaning that exempting an end user will only
exempt them from enforcement when creating pods directly, but not when creating a workload resource.
Controller service accounts (such as `system:serviceaccount:kube-system:replicaset-controller`)
should generally not be exempted, as doing so would implicitly exempt any user that can create the
corresponding workload resource.

{{< /caution >}}

Updates to the following pod fields are exempt from policy checks, meaning that if a pod update
request only changes these fields, it will not be denied even if the pod is in violation of the
current policy level:

- Any metadata updates **except** changes to the seccomp or AppArmor annotations:
  - `seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod` (deprecated)
  - `container.seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/*` (deprecated)
  - `container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/*`
- Valid updates to `.spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`
- Valid updates to `.spec.tolerations`
