<!-- overview -->

{{< feature-state for_k8s_version="v1.22" state="alpha" >}}

System component traces record the latency of and relationships between operations in the cluster.

Kubernetes components emit traces using the
[OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md#opentelemetry-protocol-specification)
with the gRPC exporter and can be collected and routed to tracing backends using an
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector#-opentelemetry-collector).

## Trace Collection

For a complete guide to collecting traces and using the collector, see
[Getting Started with the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/).
However, there are a few things to note that are specific to Kubernetes components.

By default, Kubernetes components export traces using the grpc exporter for OTLP on the
[IANA OpenTelemetry port](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=opentelemetry), 4317.
As an example, if the collector is running as a sidecar to a Kubernetes component,
the following receiver configuration will collect spans and log them to standard output:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
exporters:
  # Replace this exporter with the exporter for your backend
  logging:
    logLevel: debug
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [logging]
```

## Component traces

### kube-apiserver traces

The kube-apiserver generates spans for incoming HTTP requests, and for outgoing requests
to webhooks, etcd, and re-entrant requests. It propagates the
[W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) with outgoing requests
but does not make use of the trace context attached to incoming requests,
as the kube-apiserver is often a public endpoint.

#### Enabling tracing in the kube-apiserver

To enable tracing, enable the `APIServerTracing`
[feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
on the kube-apiserver. Also, provide the kube-apiserver with a tracing configration file
with `--tracing-config-file=<path-to-config>`. This is an example config that records
spans for 1 in 10000 requests, and uses the default OpenTelemetry endpoint:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: TracingConfiguration
# default value
#endpoint: localhost:4317
samplingRatePerMillion: 100
```

For more information about the `TracingConfiguration` struct, see
[API server config API (v1beta1)](/docs/reference/config-api/apiserver-config.v1beta1/#apiserver-k8s-io-v1beta1-TracingConfiguration).

## Stability

Tracing instrumentation is still under active development, and may change
in a variety of ways. This includes span names, attached attributes,
instrumented endpoints, etc. Until this feature graduates to stable,
there are no guarantees of backwards compatibility for tracing instrumentation.
