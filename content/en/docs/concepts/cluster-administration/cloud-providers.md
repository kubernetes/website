### kubeadm
[kubeadm](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/) is a popular option for creating kubernetes clusters.
kubeadm has configuration options to specify configuration information for cloud providers. For example a typical
in-tree cloud provider can be configured using kubeadm as shown below:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: InitConfiguration
nodeRegistration:
  kubeletExtraArgs:
    cloud-provider: "openstack"
    cloud-config: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
---
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: ClusterConfiguration
kubernetesVersion: v1.13.0
apiServer:
  extraArgs:
    cloud-provider: "openstack"
    cloud-config: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
  extraVolumes:
  - name: cloud
    hostPath: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
    mountPath: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
controllerManager:
  extraArgs:
    cloud-provider: "openstack"
    cloud-config: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
  extraVolumes:
  - name: cloud
    hostPath: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
    mountPath: "/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf"
```

The in-tree cloud providers typically need both `--cloud-provider` and `--cloud-config` specified in the command lines
for the [kube-apiserver](/docs/admin/kube-apiserver/), [kube-controller-manager](/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/) and the
[kubelet](/docs/admin/kubelet/). The contents of the file specified in `--cloud-config` for each provider is documented below as well.

For all external cloud providers, please follow the instructions on the individual repositories,
which are listed under their headings below, or one may view [the list of all repositories](https://github.com/kubernetes?q=cloud-provider-&type=&language=)

## AWS
This section describes all the possible configurations which can
be used when running Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services.

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws#readme)

### Node Name

The AWS cloud provider uses the private DNS name of the AWS instance as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.

### Load Balancers
You can setup [external load balancers](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/)
to use specific features in AWS by configuring the annotations as shown below.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    run: example
  annotations:
     service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:xx-xxxx-x:xxxxxxxxx:xxxxxxx/xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx #replace this value
     service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol: http
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 443
    targetPort: 5556
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: example
```
Different settings can be applied to a load balancer service in AWS using _annotations_. The following describes the annotations supported on AWS ELBs:

* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-access-log-emit-interval`: Used to specify access log emit interval.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-access-log-enabled`: Used on the service to enable or disable access logs.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-access-log-s3-bucket-name`: Used to specify access log s3 bucket name.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-access-log-s3-bucket-prefix`: Used to specify access log s3 bucket prefix.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-additional-resource-tags`: Used on the service to specify a comma-separated list of key-value pairs which will be recorded as additional tags in the ELB. For example: `"Key1=Val1,Key2=Val2,KeyNoVal1=,KeyNoVal2"`.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-backend-protocol`: Used on the service to specify the protocol spoken by the backend (pod) behind a listener. If `http` (default) or `https`, an HTTPS listener that terminates the connection and parses headers is created. If set to `ssl` or `tcp`, a "raw" SSL listener is used. If set to `http` and `aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert` is not used then a HTTP listener is used.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert`: Used on the service to request a secure listener. Value is a valid certificate ARN. For more, see [ELB Listener Config](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html) CertARN is an IAM or CM certificate ARN, for example `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-draining-enabled`: Used on the service to enable or disable connection draining.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-draining-timeout`: Used on the service to specify a connection draining timeout.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-idle-timeout`: Used on the service to specify the idle connection timeout.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled`: Used on the service to enable or disable cross-zone load balancing.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-security-groups`: Used to specify the security groups to be added to ELB created. This replaces all other security groups previously assigned to the ELB.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-extra-security-groups`: Used on the service to specify additional security groups to be added to ELB created
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal`: Used on the service to indicate that we want an internal ELB.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol`: Used on the service to enable the proxy protocol on an ELB. Right now we only accept the value `*` which means enabling the proxy protocol on all ELB backends. In the future we could adjust this to allow setting the proxy protocol only on certain backends.
* `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-ports`: Used on the service to specify a comma-separated list of ports that will use SSL/HTTPS listeners. Defaults to `*` (all)

The information for the annotations for AWS is taken from the comments on [aws.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/legacy-cloud-providers/blob/master/aws/aws.go)

## Azure

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [kubernetes/cloud-provider-azure](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-azure#readme)

### Node Name

The Azure cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the Azure VM name.

## CloudStack

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-kubernetes-provider)

### Node Name

The CloudStack cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the CloudStack VM name.

## GCE

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [kubernetes/cloud-provider-gcp](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-gcp#readme)

### Node Name

The GCE cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the first segment of the Kubernetes Node name must match the GCE instance name (e.g. a Node named `kubernetes-node-2.c.my-proj.internal` must correspond to an instance named `kubernetes-node-2`).

## HUAWEI CLOUD

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-huaweicloud](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-huaweicloud).

### Node Name

The HUAWEI CLOUD provider needs the private IP address of the node as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Please make sure indicating `--hostname-override=<node private IP>` when starting kubelet on the node.

## OpenStack
This section describes all the possible configurations which can
be used when using OpenStack with Kubernetes.

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack#readme)

### Node Name

The OpenStack cloud provider uses the instance name (as determined from OpenStack metadata) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the instance name must be a valid Kubernetes Node name in order for the kubelet to successfully register its Node object.

### Services

The OpenStack cloud provider
implementation for Kubernetes supports the use of these OpenStack services from
the underlying cloud, where available:

| Service                  | API Version(s) | Required |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------|
| Block Storage (Cinder)   | V1†, V2, V3    | No       |
| Compute (Nova)           | V2             | No       |
| Identity (Keystone)      | V2‡,  V3       | Yes      |
| Load Balancing (Neutron) | V1§, V2        | No       |
| Load Balancing (Octavia) | V2             | No       |

† Block Storage V1 API support is deprecated, Block Storage V3 API support was
added in Kubernetes 1.9.

‡ Identity V2 API support is deprecated and will be removed from the provider in
a future release. As of the "Queens" release, OpenStack will no longer expose the
Identity V2 API.

§ Load Balancing V1 API support was removed in Kubernetes 1.9.

Service discovery is achieved by listing the service catalog managed by
OpenStack Identity (Keystone) using the `auth-url` provided in the provider
configuration. The provider will gracefully degrade in functionality when
OpenStack services other than Keystone are not available and simply disclaim
support for impacted features. Certain features are also enabled or disabled
based on the list of extensions published by Neutron in the underlying cloud.

### cloud.conf
Kubernetes knows how to interact with OpenStack via the file cloud.conf. It is
the file that will provide Kubernetes with credentials and location for the OpenStack auth endpoint.
You can create a cloud.conf file by specifying the following details in it

#### Typical configuration
This is an example of a typical configuration that touches the values that most
often need to be set. It points the provider at the OpenStack cloud's Keystone
endpoint, provides details for how to authenticate with it, and configures the
load balancer:

```yaml
[Global]
username=user
password=pass
auth-url=https://<keystone_ip>/identity/v3
tenant-id=c869168a828847f39f7f06edd7305637
domain-id=2a73b8f597c04551a0fdc8e95544be8a

[LoadBalancer]
subnet-id=6937f8fa-858d-4bc9-a3a5-18d2c957166a
```

##### Global
These configuration options for the OpenStack provider pertain to its global
configuration and should appear in the `[Global]` section of the `cloud.conf`
file:

* `auth-url` (Required): The URL of the keystone API used to authenticate. On
  OpenStack control panels, this can be found at Access and Security > API
  Access > Credentials.
* `username` (Required): Refers to the username of a valid user set in keystone.
* `password` (Required): Refers to the password of a valid user set in keystone.
* `tenant-id` (Required): Used to specify the id of the project where you want
  to create your resources.
* `tenant-name` (Optional): Used to specify the name of the project where you
  want to create your resources.
* `trust-id` (Optional): Used to specify the identifier of the trust to use for
  authorization. A trust represents a user's (the trustor) authorization to
  delegate roles to another user (the trustee), and optionally allow the trustee
  to impersonate the trustor. Available trusts are found under the
  `/v3/OS-TRUST/trusts` endpoint of the Keystone API.
* `domain-id` (Optional): Used to specify the id of the domain your user belongs
  to.
* `domain-name` (Optional): Used to specify the name of the domain your user
  belongs to.
* `region` (Optional): Used to specify the identifier of the region to use when
  running on a multi-region OpenStack cloud. A region is a general division of
  an OpenStack deployment. Although a region does not have a strict geographical
  connotation, a deployment can use a geographical name for a region identifier
  such as `us-east`. Available regions are found under the `/v3/regions`
  endpoint of the Keystone API.
* `ca-file` (Optional): Used to specify the path to your custom CA file.


When using Keystone V3 - which changes tenant to project - the `tenant-id` value
is automatically mapped to the project construct in the API.

#####  Load Balancer
These configuration options for the OpenStack provider pertain to the load
balancer and should appear in the `[LoadBalancer]` section of the `cloud.conf`
file:

* `lb-version` (Optional): Used to override automatic version detection. Valid
  values are `v1` or `v2`. Where no value is provided automatic detection will
  select the highest supported version exposed by the underlying OpenStack
  cloud.
* `use-octavia` (Optional): Used to determine whether to look for and use an
  Octavia LBaaS V2 service catalog endpoint. Valid values are `true` or `false`.
  Where `true` is specified and an Octaiva LBaaS V2 entry can not be found, the
  provider will fall back and attempt to find a Neutron LBaaS V2 endpoint
  instead. The default value is `false`.
* `subnet-id` (Optional): Used to specify the id of the subnet you want to
  create your loadbalancer on. Can be found at Network > Networks. Click on the
  respective network to get its subnets.
* `floating-network-id` (Optional): If specified, will create a floating IP for
  the load balancer.
* `lb-method` (Optional): Used to specify an algorithm by which load will be
  distributed amongst members of the load balancer pool. The value can be
  `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_CONNECTIONS`, or `SOURCE_IP`. The default behavior if
  none is specified is `ROUND_ROBIN`.
* `lb-provider` (Optional): Used to specify the provider of the load balancer.
  If not specified, the default provider service configured in neutron will be
  used.
* `create-monitor` (Optional): Indicates whether or not to create a health
  monitor for the Neutron load balancer. Valid values are `true` and `false`.
  The default is `false`. When `true` is specified then `monitor-delay`,
  `monitor-timeout`, and `monitor-max-retries` must also be set.
* `monitor-delay` (Optional): The time between sending probes to
  members of the load balancer. Ensure that you specify a valid time unit. The valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
* `monitor-timeout` (Optional): Maximum time for a monitor to wait
  for a ping reply before it times out. The value must be less than the delay
  value. Ensure that you specify a valid time unit. The valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"
* `monitor-max-retries` (Optional): Number of permissible ping failures before
  changing the load balancer member's status to INACTIVE. Must be a number
  between 1 and 10.
* `manage-security-groups` (Optional): Determines whether or not the load
  balancer should automatically manage the security group rules. Valid values
  are `true` and `false`. The default is `false`. When `true` is specified
  `node-security-group` must also be supplied.
* `node-security-group` (Optional): ID of the security group to manage.

##### Block Storage
These configuration options for the OpenStack provider pertain to block storage
and should appear in the `[BlockStorage]` section of the `cloud.conf` file:

* `bs-version` (Optional): Used to override automatic version detection. Valid
  values are `v1`, `v2`, `v3` and `auto`. When `auto` is specified automatic
  detection will select the highest supported version exposed by the underlying
  OpenStack cloud. The default value if none is provided is `auto`.
* `trust-device-path` (Optional): In most scenarios the block device names
  provided by Cinder (e.g. `/dev/vda`) can not be trusted. This boolean toggles
  this behavior. Setting it to `true` results in trusting the block device names
  provided by Cinder. The default value of `false` results in the discovery of
  the device path based on its serial number and `/dev/disk/by-id` mapping and is
  the recommended approach.
* `ignore-volume-az` (Optional): Used to influence availability zone use when
  attaching Cinder volumes. When Nova and Cinder have different availability
  zones, this should be set to `true`. This is most commonly the case where
  there are many Nova availability zones but only one Cinder availability zone.
  The default value is `false` to preserve the behavior used in earlier
  releases, but may change in the future.
* `node-volume-attach-limit` (Optional): Maximum number of Volumes that can be
  attached to the node, default is 256 for cinder.

If deploying Kubernetes versions <= 1.8 on an OpenStack deployment that uses
paths rather than ports to differentiate between endpoints it may be necessary
to explicitly set the `bs-version` parameter. A path based endpoint is of the
form `http://foo.bar/volume` while a port based endpoint is of the form
`http://foo.bar:xxx`.

In environments that use path based endpoints and Kubernetes is using the older
auto-detection logic a `BS API version autodetection failed.` error will be
returned on attempting volume detachment. To workaround this issue it is
possible to force the use of Cinder API version 2 by adding this to the cloud
provider configuration:

```yaml
[BlockStorage]
bs-version=v2
```

##### Metadata
These configuration options for the OpenStack provider pertain to metadata and
should appear in the `[Metadata]` section of the `cloud.conf` file:

* `search-order` (Optional): This configuration key influences the way that the
  provider retrieves metadata relating to the instance(s) in which it runs. The
  default value of `configDrive,metadataService` results in the provider
  retrieving metadata relating to the instance from the config drive first if
  available and then the metadata service. Alternative values are:
  * `configDrive` - Only retrieve instance metadata from the configuration
    drive.
  * `metadataService` - Only retrieve instance metadata from the metadata
    service.
  * `metadataService,configDrive` - Retrieve instance metadata from the metadata
    service first if available, then the configuration drive.

  Influencing this behavior may be desirable as the metadata on the
  configuration drive may grow stale over time, whereas the metadata service
  always provides the most up to date view. Not all OpenStack clouds provide
  both configuration drive and metadata service though and only one or the other
  may be available which is why the default is to check both.

##### Route

These configuration options for the OpenStack provider pertain to the [kubenet]
Kubernetes network plugin and should appear in the `[Route]` section of the
`cloud.conf` file:

* `router-id` (Optional): If the underlying cloud's Neutron deployment supports
  the `extraroutes` extension then use `router-id` to specify a router to add
  routes to.  The router chosen must span the private networks containing your
  cluster nodes (typically there is only one node network, and this value should be
  the default router for the node network).  This value is required to use [kubenet]
  on OpenStack.

## OVirt

### Node Name

The OVirt cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the VM FQDN (reported by OVirt under `<vm><guest_info><fqdn>...</fqdn></guest_info></vm>`)

## Photon

### Node Name

The Photon cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the Photon VM name (or if `overrideIP` is set to true in the `--cloud-config`, the Kubernetes Node name must match the Photon VM IP address).

## vSphere

{{< tabs name="vSphere cloud provider" >}}
{{% tab name="vSphere >= 6.7U3" %}}
For all vSphere deployments on vSphere >= 6.7U3, the [external vSphere cloud provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-vsphere), along with the [vSphere CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/vsphere-csi-driver) is recommended. See [Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster on vSphere with CSI and CPI](https://cloud-provider-vsphere.sigs.k8s.io/tutorials/kubernetes-on-vsphere-with-kubeadm.html) for a quick start guide.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="vSphere < 6.7U3" %}}
If you are running vSphere < 6.7U3, the in-tree vSphere cloud provider is recommended. See [Running a Kubernetes Cluster on vSphere with kubeadm](https://cloud-provider-vsphere.sigs.k8s.io/tutorials/k8s-vcp-on-vsphere-with-kubeadm.html) for a quick start guide.

## IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

### Compute nodes
By using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provider, you can create clusters with a mixture of virtual and physical (bare metal) nodes in a single zone or across multiple zones in a region. For more information, see [Planning your cluster and worker node setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#plan_clusters).

The name of the Kubernetes Node object is the private IP address of the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service worker node instance.

### Networking
The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provider provides VLANs for quality network performance and network isolation for nodes. You can set up custom firewalls and Calico network policies to add an extra layer of security for your cluster, or connect your cluster to your on-prem data center via VPN. For more information, see [Planning in-cluster and private networking](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_cluster#cs_network_cluster).

To expose apps to the public or within the cluster, you can leverage NodePort, LoadBalancer, or Ingress services. You can also customize the Ingress application load balancer with annotations. For more information, see [Planning to expose your apps with external networking](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_network_planning#cs_network_planning).

### Storage
The IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provider leverages Kubernetes-native persistent volumes to enable users to mount file, block, and cloud object storage to their apps. You can also use database-as-a-service and third-party add-ons for persistent storage of your data. For more information, see [Planning highly available persistent storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-storage_planning#storage_planning).

## Baidu Cloud Container Engine

### Node Name

The Baidu cloud provider uses the private IP address of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the Baidu VM private IP.

## Tencent Kubernetes Engine

If you wish to use the external cloud provider, its repository is [TencentCloud/tencentcloud-cloud-controller-manager](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-cloud-controller-manager).

### Node Name

The Tencent cloud provider uses the hostname of the node (as determined by the kubelet or overridden with `--hostname-override`) as the name of the Kubernetes Node object.
Note that the Kubernetes Node name must match the Tencent VM private IP.
