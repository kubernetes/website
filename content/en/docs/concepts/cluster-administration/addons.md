## Networking and Network Policy


* [ACI](https://www.github.com/noironetworks/aci-containers) provides integrated container networking and network security with Cisco ACI.
* [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/latest/getting-started/kubernetes/) is a secure L3 networking and network policy provider.
* [Canal](https://github.com/tigera/canal/tree/master/k8s-install) unites Flannel and Calico, providing networking and network policy.
* [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) is a L3 network and network policy plugin that can enforce HTTP/API/L7 policies transparently. Both routing and overlay/encapsulation mode are supported.
* [CNI-Genie](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie) enables Kubernetes to seamlessly connect to a choice of CNI plugins, such as Calico, Canal, Flannel, Romana, or Weave.
* [Contiv](http://contiv.github.io) provides configurable networking (native L3 using BGP, overlay using vxlan, classic L2, and Cisco-SDN/ACI) for various use cases and a rich policy framework. Contiv project is fully [open sourced](http://github.com/contiv). The [installer](http://github.com/contiv/install) provides both kubeadm and non-kubeadm based installation options.
* [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kubernetes.md) is an overlay network provider that can be used with Kubernetes.
* [Multus](https://github.com/Intel-Corp/multus-cni) is a Multi plugin for multiple network support in Kubernetes to support all CNI plugins (e.g. Calico, Cilium, Contiv, Flannel), in addition to SRIOV, DPDK, OVS-DPDK and VPP based workloads in Kubernetes.
* [NSX-T](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.0/nsxt_20_ncp_kubernetes.pdf) Container Plug-in (NCP) provides integration between VMware NSX-T and container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, as well as integration between NSX-T and container-based CaaS/PaaS platforms such as Pivotal Container Service (PKS) and Openshift. 
* [Nuage](https://github.com/nuagenetworks/nuage-kubernetes/blob/v5.1.1-1/docs/kubernetes-1-installation.rst) is an SDN platform that provides policy-based networking between Kubernetes Pods and non-Kubernetes environments with visibility and security monitoring.
* [Romana](http://romana.io) is a Layer 3 networking solution for pod networks that also supports the [NetworkPolicy API](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). Kubeadm add-on installation details available [here](https://github.com/romana/romana/tree/master/containerize).
* [Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kube-addon/) provides networking and network policy, will carry on working on both sides of a network partition, and does not require an external database.

## Service Discovery

* [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io) is a flexible, extensible DNS server which can be [installed](https://github.com/coredns/deployment/tree/master/kubernetes) as the in-cluster DNS for pods.

## Visualization &amp; Control

* [Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard#kubernetes-dashboard) is a dashboard web interface for Kubernetes.
* [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/documentation/scope-latest-installing/#k8s) is a tool for graphically visualizing your containers, pods, services etc. Use it in conjunction with a [Weave Cloud account](https://cloud.weave.works/) or host the UI yourself.

## Legacy Add-ons

There are several other add-ons documented in the deprecated [cluster/addons](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/cluster/addons) directory.

Well-maintained ones should be linked to here. PRs welcome!
