{{% capture overview %}}
Kubernetes approaches networking somewhat differently than Docker does by
default.  There are 4 distinct networking problems to solve:

1. Highly-coupled container-to-container communications: this is solved by
   [pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) and `localhost` communications.
2. Pod-to-Pod communications: this is the primary focus of this document.
3. Pod-to-Service communications: this is covered by [services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
4. External-to-Service communications: this is covered by [services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

Kubernetes assumes that pods can communicate with other pods, regardless of
which host they land on.  Every pod gets its own IP address so you do not
need to explicitly create links between pods and you almost never need to deal
with mapping container ports to host ports.  This creates a clean,
backwards-compatible model where pods can be treated much like VMs or physical
hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load
balancing, application configuration, and migration.

There are requirements imposed on how you set up your cluster networking to
achieve this.

## Docker model

Before discussing the Kubernetes approach to networking, it is worthwhile to
review the "normal" way that networking works with Docker.  By default, Docker
uses host-private networking.  It creates a virtual bridge, called `docker0` by
default, and allocates a subnet from one of the private address blocks defined
in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) for that bridge.  For each
container that Docker creates, it allocates a virtual Ethernet device (called
`veth`) which is attached to the bridge. The veth is mapped to appear as `eth0`
in the container, using Linux namespaces.  The in-container `eth0` interface is
given an IP address from the bridge's address range.

The result is that Docker containers can talk to other containers only if they
are on the same machine (and thus the same virtual bridge).  Containers on
different machines can not reach each other - in fact they may end up with the
exact same network ranges and IP addresses.

In order for Docker containers to communicate across nodes, there must
be allocated ports on the machineâ€™s own IP address, which are then
forwarded or proxied to the containers. This obviously means that
containers must either coordinate which ports they use very carefully
or ports must be allocated dynamically.

## Kubernetes model

Coordinating ports across multiple developers is very difficult to do at
scale and exposes users to cluster-level issues outside of their control.
Dynamic port allocation brings a lot of complications to the system - every
application has to take ports as flags, the API servers have to know how to
insert dynamic port numbers into configuration blocks, services have to know
how to find each other, etc.  Rather than deal with this, Kubernetes takes a
different approach.

Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking
implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):

   * all containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT
   * all nodes can communicate with all containers (and vice-versa) without NAT
   * the IP that a container sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as

What this means in practice is that you can not just take two computers
running Docker and expect Kubernetes to work.  You must ensure that the
fundamental requirements are met.

This model is not only less complex overall, but it is principally compatible
with the desire for Kubernetes to enable low-friction porting of apps from VMs
to containers.  If your job previously ran in a VM, your VM had an IP and could
talk to other VMs in your project.  This is the same basic model.

Until now this document has talked about containers.  In reality, Kubernetes
applies IP addresses at the `Pod` scope - containers within a `Pod` share their
network namespaces - including their IP address.  This means that containers
within a `Pod` can all reach each other's ports on `localhost`. This does imply
that containers within a `Pod` must coordinate port usage, but this is no
different than processes in a VM.  This is called the "IP-per-pod" model.  This
is implemented, using Docker, as a "pod container" which holds the network namespace
open while "app containers" (the things the user specified) join that namespace
with Docker's `--net=container:<id>` function.

As with Docker, it is possible to request host ports, but this is reduced to a
very niche operation.  In this case a port will be allocated on the host `Node`
and traffic will be forwarded to the `Pod`.  The `Pod` itself is blind to the
existence or non-existence of host ports.

## How to implement the Kubernetes networking model

There are a number of ways that this network model can be implemented.  This
document is not an exhaustive study of the various methods, but hopefully serves
as an introduction to various technologies and serves as a jumping-off point.

The following networking options are sorted alphabetically - the order does not
imply any preferential status.

### ACI

[Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/index.html) offers an integrated overlay and underlay SDN solution that supports containers, virtual machines, and bare metal servers. [ACI](https://www.github.com/noironetworks/aci-containers) provides container networking integration for ACI. An overview of the integration is provided [here](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/solutions/collateral/data-center-virtualization/application-centric-infrastructure/solution-overview-c22-739493.pdf).

### AOS from Apstra

[AOS](http://www.apstra.com/products/aos/) is an Intent-Based Networking system that creates and manages complex datacenter environments from a simple integrated platform.  AOS leverages a highly scalable distributed design to eliminate network outages while minimizing costs.

The AOS Reference Design currently supports Layer-3 connected hosts that eliminate legacy Layer-2 switching problems.  These Layer-3 hosts can be Linux servers (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS) that create BGP neighbor relationships directly with the top of rack switches (TORs).  AOS automates the routing adjacencies and then provides fine grained control over the route health injections (RHI) that are common in a Kubernetes deployment.

AOS has a rich set of REST API endpoints that enable Kubernetes to quickly change the network policy based on application requirements.  Further enhancements will integrate the AOS Graph model used for the network design with the workload provisioning, enabling an end to end management system for both private and public clouds.

AOS supports the use of common vendor equipment from manufacturers including Cisco, Arista, Dell, Mellanox, HPE, and a large number of white-box systems and open network operating systems like Microsoft SONiC, Dell OPX, and Cumulus Linux.

Details on how the AOS system works can be accessed here: http://www.apstra.com/products/how-it-works/

### Big Cloud Fabric from Big Switch Networks
 
[Big Cloud Fabric](https://www.bigswitch.com/container-network-automation) is a cloud native networking architecture, designed to run Kubernetes in private cloud/on-premises environments. Using unified physical & virtual SDN, Big Cloud Fabric tackles inherent container networking problems such as load balancing, visibility, troubleshooting, security policies & container traffic monitoring. 

With the help of the Big Cloud Fabric's virtual pod multi-tenant architecture, container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, RedHat Openshift, Mesosphere DC/OS & Docker Swarm will be natively integrated along side with VM orchestration systems such as VMware, OpenStack & Nutanix. Customers will be able to securely inter-connect any number of these clusters and enable inter-tenant communication between them if needed. 

BCF was recognized by Gartner as a visionary in the latest [Magic Quadrant](http://go.bigswitch.com/17GatedDocuments-MagicQuadrantforDataCenterNetworking_Reg.html). One of the BCF Kubernetes on-premises deployments (which includes Kubernetes, DC/OS & VMware running on multiple DCs across different geographic regions) is also referenced [here](https://portworx.com/architects-corner-kubernetes-satya-komala-nio/).

### Flannel

[Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel) is a very simple overlay
network that satisfies the Kubernetes requirements. Many
people have reported success with Flannel and Kubernetes.

### Google Compute Engine (GCE)

For the Google Compute Engine cluster configuration scripts, [advanced
routing](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/routes) is used to
assign each VM a subnet (default is `/24` - 254 IPs).  Any traffic bound for that
subnet will be routed directly to the VM by the GCE network fabric.  This is in
addition to the "main" IP address assigned to the VM, which is NAT'ed for
outbound internet access.  A linux bridge (called `cbr0`) is configured to exist
on that subnet, and is passed to docker's `--bridge` flag.

Docker is started with:

```shell
DOCKER_OPTS="--bridge=cbr0 --iptables=false --ip-masq=false"
```

This bridge is created by Kubelet (controlled by the `--network-plugin=kubenet`
flag) according to the `Node`'s `.spec.podCIDR`.

Docker will now allocate IPs from the `cbr-cidr` block.  Containers can reach
each other and `Nodes` over the `cbr0` bridge.  Those IPs are all routable
within the GCE project network.

GCE itself does not know anything about these IPs, though, so it will not NAT
them for outbound internet traffic.  To achieve that an iptables rule is used 
to masquerade (aka SNAT - to make it seem as if packets came from the `Node`
itself) traffic that is bound for IPs outside the GCE project network
(10.0.0.0/8).

```shell
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -d 10.0.0.0/8 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Lastly IP forwarding is enabled in the kernel (so the kernel will process
packets for bridged containers):

```shell
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

The result of all this is that all `Pods` can reach each other and can egress
traffic to the internet.

### Kube-router

[Kube-router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router) is a purpose-built networking solution for Kubernetes that aims to provide high performance and operational simplicity. Kube-router provides a Linux [LVS/IPVS](http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/software/ipvs.html)-based service proxy, a Linux kernel forwarding-based pod-to-pod networking solution with no overlays, and iptables/ipset-based network policy enforcer.

### L2 networks and linux bridging

If you have a "dumb" L2 network, such as a simple switch in a "bare-metal"
environment, you should be able to do something similar to the above GCE setup.
Note that these instructions have only been tried very casually - it seems to
work, but has not been thoroughly tested.  If you use this technique and
perfect the process, please let us know.

### Romana

[Romana](http://romana.io) is an open source network and security automation solution that lets you deploy Kubernetes without an overlay network. Romana supports Kubernetes [Network Policy](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) to provide isolation across network namespaces.

### Weave Net from Weaveworks

[Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net/) is a
resilient and simple to use network for Kubernetes and its hosted applications.
Weave Net runs as a [CNI plug-in](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/cni-plugin/)
or stand-alone.  In either version, it doesn't require any configuration or extra code
to run, and in both cases, the network provides one IP address per pod - as is standard for Kubernetes.
