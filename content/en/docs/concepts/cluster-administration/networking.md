<!-- overview -->
Networking is a central part of Kubernetes, but it can be challenging to
understand exactly how it is expected to work.  There are 4 distinct networking
problems to address:

1. Highly-coupled container-to-container communications: this is solved by
   {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pods" term_id="pod" >}} and `localhost` communications.
2. Pod-to-Pod communications: this is the primary focus of this document.
3. Pod-to-Service communications: this is covered by [Services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
4. External-to-Service communications: this is also covered by Services.

<!-- body -->

Kubernetes is all about sharing machines between applications.  Typically,
sharing machines requires ensuring that two applications do not try to use the
same ports.  Coordinating ports across multiple developers is very difficult to
do at scale and exposes users to cluster-level issues outside of their control.

Dynamic port allocation brings a lot of complications to the system - every
application has to take ports as flags, the API servers have to know how to
insert dynamic port numbers into configuration blocks, services have to know
how to find each other, etc.  Rather than deal with this, Kubernetes takes a
different approach.

To learn about the Kubernetes networking model, see [here](/docs/concepts/services-networking/).

## Kubernetes IP address ranges

Kubernetes clusters require to allocate non-overlapping IP addresses for Pods, Services and Nodes,
from a range of available addresses configured in the following components:

- The network plugin is configured to assign IP addresses to Pods.
- The kube-apiserver is configured to assign IP addresses to Services.
- The kubelet or the cloud-controller-manager is configured to assign IP addresses to Nodes.

## Cluster networking types {#cluster-network-ipfamilies}

Kubernetes clusters, attending to the IP families configured, can be categorized into:

- IPv4 only: The network plugin, kube-apiserver and kubelet/cloud-controller-manager are configured to assign only IPv4 addresses.
- IPv6 only: The network plugin, kube-apiserver and kubelet/cloud-controller-manager are configured to assign only IPv6 addresses.
- IPv4/IPv6 or IPv6/IPv4 [dual-stack](/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/):
  - The network plugin is configured to assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
  - The kube-apiserver is configured to assign IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
  - The kubelet or cloud-controller-manager is configured to assign IPv4 and IPv6 address.
  - All components must agree on the configured primary IP family.

Kubernetes clusters only consider the IP families present on the Pods, Services and Nodes objects,
independently of the existing IPs of the represented objects. Per example, a server or a pod can have multiple
IP addresses on its interfaces, but only the IP addresses in `node.status.addresses` or `pod.status.ips` are
considered for implementing the Kubernetes network model and defining the type of the cluster.

## How to implement the Kubernetes network model

The network model is implemented by the container runtime on each node. The most common container
runtimes use [Container Network Interface](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) (CNI)
plugins to manage their network and security capabilities. Many different CNI plugins exist from
many different vendors. Some of these provide only basic features of adding and removing network
interfaces, while others provide more sophisticated solutions, such as integration with other
container orchestration systems, running multiple CNI plugins, advanced IPAM features etc.

See [this page](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy)
for a non-exhaustive list of networking addons supported by Kubernetes.

The early design of the networking model and its rationale are described in more detail in the
[networking design document](https://git.k8s.io/design-proposals-archive/network/networking.md).
