{{% capture overview %}}

If you would like to help contribute to the Kubernetes documentation or website,
we're happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you're new to the
project or you've been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a
developer, an end user, or someone who just can't stand seeing typos.

## Getting Started

Anyone can open an issue describing problems or desired improvements with documentation, or contribute a change with a pull request (PR).
Some tasks require more trust and need more access in the Kubernetes organization.
See [Participating in SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/) for more details about
of roles and permissions.

Kubernetes documentation resides in a GitHub repository. While we welcome
contributions from anyone, you do need basic comfort with git and GitHub to
operate effectively in the Kubernetes community.

To get involved with documentation:

1. Sign the CNCF [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).
2. Familiarize yourself with the [documentation repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) and the website's [static site generator](https://gohugo.io).
3. Make sure you understand the basic processes for [improving content](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/start/#improve-existing-content) and [reviewing changes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/start/#review-docs-pull-requests).

## Other ways to contribute

- To contribute to the Kubernetes community through online forums like Twitter or Stack Overflow, or learn about local meetups and Kubernetes events, visit the [Kubernetes community site](/community/).
- To contribute to feature development, read the [contributor cheatsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet) to get started.
