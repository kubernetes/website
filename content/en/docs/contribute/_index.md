## Getting started

Anyone can open an issue about documentation, or contribute a change with a pull request (PR) to the [`kubernetes/website` GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website). You need to be comfortable with [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://lab.github.com/) to operate effectively in the Kubernetes community.

To get involved with documentation:

1. Sign the CNCF [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).
2. Familiarize yourself with the [documentation repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) and the website's [static site generator](https://gohugo.io).
3. Make sure you understand the basic processes for [opening a pull request](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/) and [reviewing changes](/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/).

Some tasks require more trust and more access in the Kubernetes organization.
See [Participating in SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/) for more details about
roles and permissions.

## Your first contribution

- Read the [Contribution overview](/docs/contribute/new-content/overview/) to learn about the different ways you can contribute.
- See [Contribute to kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/contribute) to find issues that make good entry points.
- [Open a pull request using GitHub](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/#changes-using-github) to existing documentation and learn more about filing issues in GitHub.
- [Review pull requests](/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/) from other Kubernetes community members for accuracy and language.
- Read the Kubernetes [content](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/) and [style guides](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) so you can leave informed comments.
- Learn how to [use page templates](/docs/contribute/style/page-templates/) and [Hugo shortcodes](/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/) to make bigger changes.

## Next steps

- Learn to [work from a local clone](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/#fork-the-repo) of the repository.
- Document [features in a release](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/).
- Participate in [SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/), and become a [member or reviewer](/docs/contribute/participating/#roles-and-responsibilities).
- Start or help with a [localization](/docs/contribute/localization/).

## Get involved with SIG Docs

[SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participating/) is the group of contributors who publish and maintain Kubernetes documentation and the website. Getting involved with SIG Docs is a great way for Kubernetes contributors (feature development or otherwise) to have a large impact on the Kubernetes project.

SIG Docs communicates with different methods:

- [Join `#sig-docs` on the Kubernetes Slack instance](http://slack.k8s.io/). Make sure to
  introduce yourself!
- [Join the `kubernetes-sig-docs` mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs),
  where broader discussions take place and official decisions are recorded.
- Join the [weekly SIG Docs video meeting](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs). Meetings are always announced on `#sig-docs` and added to the [Kubernetes community meetings calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cgnt364vd8s86hr2phapfjc6uk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). You'll need to download the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) or dial in using a phone.

## Other ways to contribute

- Visit the [Kubernetes community site](/community/). Participate on Twitter or Stack Overflow, learn about local Kubernetes meetups and events, and more.
- Read the [contributor cheatsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet) to get involved with Kubernetes feature development.
- Submit a [blog post or case study](/docs/contribute/new-content/blogs-case-studies/).
