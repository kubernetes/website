If you would like to help contribute to the Kubernetes documentation or website,
we're happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you're new to the
project or you've been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a
developer, an end user, or someone who just can't stand seeing typos.

For more ways to get involved in the Kubernetes community or to learn about us, visit the [Kubernetes community site](/community/). 
For information on the Kubernetes documentation style guide, see the [style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/).

## Types of contributors

- A _member_ of the Kubernetes organization who has [signed the CLA](/docs/contribute/start#sign-the-cla)
  and contributed some time and effort to the project. See
  [Community membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)
  for specific criteria for membership.
- A SIG Docs _reviewer_ is a member of the Kubernetes organization who has
  expressed interest in reviewing documentation pull requests and who has been
  added to the appropriate Github group and `OWNERS` files in the Github
  repository, by a SIG Docs Approver.
- A SIG Docs _approver_ is a member in good standing who has shown a continued
  commitment to the project. An approver can merge pull requests
  and publish content on behalf of the Kubernetes organization.
  Approvers can also represent SIG Docs in the larger Kubernetes community.
  Some of the duties of a SIG Docs approver, such as coordinating a release,
  require a significant time commitment.

## Ways to contribute

This list is divided into things anyone can do, things Kubernetes organization
members can do, and things that require a higher level of access and familiarity
with SIG Docs processes. Contributing consistently over time can help you
understand some of the tooling and organizational decisions that have already
been made.
