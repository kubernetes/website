This website is maintained by [Kubernetes SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/#get-involved-with-sig-docs).

- Improve existing content
- Create new content
- Translate the documentation
- Manage and publish the documentation parts of the Kubernetes release cycle

<!-- body -->

## Getting started

Anyone can open an issue about documentation, or contribute a change with a
pull request (PR) to the
[`kubernetes/website` GitHub repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website).
You need to be comfortable with
[git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://lab.github.com/)
to work effectively in the Kubernetes community.

To get involved with documentation:

1. Sign the CNCF [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).
1. Familiarize yourself with the [documentation repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website)
   and the website's [static site generator](https://gohugo.io).
1. Make sure you understand the basic processes for
   [opening a pull request](/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/) and
   [reviewing changes](/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/).

Some tasks require more trust and more access in the Kubernetes organization.
See [Participating in SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participate/) for more details about
roles and permissions.

## Your first contribution

- Read the [Contribution overview](/docs/contribute/new-content/overview/) to
  learn about the different ways you can contribute.
- Check [`kubernetes/website` issues list](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/)
  for issues that make good entry points.
- [Open a pull request using GitHub](/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/#changes-using-github)
  to existing documentation and learn more about filing issues in GitHub.
- [Review pull requests](/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs/) from other
  Kubernetes community members for accuracy and language.
- Read the Kubernetes [content](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/) and
  [style guides](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) so you can leave informed comments.
- Learn about [page content types](/docs/contribute/style/page-content-types/)
  and [Hugo shortcodes](/docs/contribute/style/hugo-shortcodes/).

## Next steps

- Learn to [work from a local clone](/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/#fork-the-repo)
  of the repository.
- Document [features in a release](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/).
- Participate in [SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participate/), and become a
  [member or reviewer](/docs/contribute/participate/roles-and-responsibilities/).
                       
- Start or help with a [localization](/docs/contribute/localization/).

## Get involved with SIG Docs

[SIG Docs](/docs/contribute/participate/) is the group of contributors who
publish and maintain Kubernetes documentation and the website. Getting
involved with SIG Docs is a great way for Kubernetes contributors (feature
development or otherwise) to have a large impact on the Kubernetes project.

SIG Docs communicates with different methods:

- [Join `#sig-docs` on the Kubernetes Slack instance](https://slack.k8s.io/). Make sure to
  introduce yourself!
- [Join the `kubernetes-sig-docs` mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs),
  where broader discussions take place and official decisions are recorded.
- Join the [weekly SIG Docs video meeting](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs). Meetings are always announced on `#sig-docs` and added to the [Kubernetes community meetings calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=cgnt364vd8s86hr2phapfjc6uk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). You'll need to download the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us/download) or dial in using a phone.

## Other ways to contribute

- Visit the [Kubernetes community site](/community/). Participate on Twitter or Stack Overflow, learn about local Kubernetes meetups and events, and more.
- Read the [contributor cheatsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/guide/contributor-cheatsheet) to get involved with Kubernetes feature development.
- Submit a [blog post or case study](/docs/contribute/new-content/blogs-case-studies/).
