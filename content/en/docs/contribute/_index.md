If you would like to help contribute to the Kubernetes documentation or website,
we're happy to have your help! Anyone can contribute, whether you're new to the
project or you've been around a long time, and whether you self-identify as a
developer, an end user, or someone who just can't stand seeing typos.

For information on the Kubernetes documentation
 content and style, see the 
 [Documentation style overview](/docs/contribute/style/style/).

## Types of docs contributors

- A _member_ of the Kubernetes organization who has [signed the CLA](/docs/contribute/start#sign-the-cla)
  and contributed some time and effort to the project. See
  [Community membership](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)
  for specific criteria for membership.
- A SIG Docs _reviewer_ is a member of the Kubernetes organization who has
  expressed interest in reviewing documentation pull requests and who has been
  added to the appropriate GitHub group and `OWNERS` files in the GitHub
  repository, by a SIG Docs Approver.
- A SIG Docs _approver_ is a member in good standing who has shown a continued
  commitment to the project. An approver can merge pull requests
  and publish content on behalf of the Kubernetes organization.
  Approvers can also represent SIG Docs in the larger Kubernetes community.
  Some of the duties of a SIG Docs approver, such as coordinating a release,
  require a significant time commitment.
