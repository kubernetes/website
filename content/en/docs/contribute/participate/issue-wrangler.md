<!-- overview -->

In order to reduce the burden on the [PR Wrangler](/docs/contribute/participate/pr-wrangler), formal approvers, and reviewers, members of SIG Docs take week long shifts [triaging and categorising issues](/docs/contribute/review/for-approvers.md/#triage-and-categorize-issues) for the repository.

<!-- body -->

## Duties

Each day in a week-long shift as Issue Wrangler:

- Triage and tag incoming issues daily. See [Triage and categorize issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/docs/contribute/review/for-approvers/#triage-and-categorize-issues) for guidelines on how SIG Docs uses metadata.
- Identifying whether the issue falls under the support category and assigning a "triage/accepted" status.
- Assuring the issue is tagged with the appropriate sig/area/kind labels.
- Keeping an eye on stale & rotten issues within the kubernetes/website repository.
- [Issues board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/72/views/1) maintenance would be nice

### Requirements

- Must be an active member of the Kubernetes organization.
- A minimum of 15 quality contributions to Kubernetes (of which a certain amount should be directed towards kubernetes/website).
- Performing the role in an informal capacity already

### What is its place in the contributor hierarchy?

- In between a contributor and a reviewer.
- For someone who assumes the role and demonstrates ability, the next step is to shadow a PR Wrangler and review PRs informally.

### Process Implementation

- Identify people who are already triaging issues and put them on a roster.
- Pilot a shadow program and gauge interest
- The mantel may be passed on if there is interest.
- Keep repeating.
