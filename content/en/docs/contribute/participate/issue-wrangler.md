<!-- overview -->

There are many issues that need triage, and in order to reduce our reliance on formal approvers or reviewers, we have introduced a new role to wrangle issues every week.The main responsibility of this role is to bridge the gap between organizational contributor and reviewer.
This section covers the duties of a PR wrangler.

## Duties

Each day in a week-long shift as Issue Wrangler:

- Making sure the issue is worded and titled correctly to provide contributors with adequate information.
- Identifying whether the issue falls under the support category and assigning a "triage/accepted" status.
- Assuring the issue is tagged with the appropriate sig/area/kind labels.
- Keeping an eye on stale & rotten issues within the kubernetes/website repository.
- [Issues board](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/72/views/1) maintenance would be nice

### Requirements

- Must be an active member of the Kubernetes organization.
- A minimum of 15 quality contributions to Kubernetes (of which a certain amount should be directed towards kubernetes/website).
- Performing the role in an informal capacity already

### What is its place in the contributor hierarchy?

- In between a contributor and a reviewer.
- For someone who assumes the role and demonstrates ability, the next step is to shadow a PR Wrangler and review PRs informally.

### Process Implementation

- Identify people who are already triaging issues and put them on a roster.
- Pilot a shadow program and gauge interest
- The mantel may be passed on if there is interest.
- Keep repeating.
