Anyone can review a documentation pull request. Visit the [pull requests](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls) section in the Kubernetes website repository to see open pull requests.

Reviewing documentation pull requests is a
great way to introduce yourself to the Kubernetes community.
It helps you learn the code base and build trust with other contributors.

Before reviewing, it's a good idea to:

- Read the  [content guide](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/) and
[style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) so you can leave informed comments.
- Understand the different [roles and responsibilities](/docs/contribute/participating/#roles-and-responsibilities) in the Kubernetes documentation community.

## Before you begin

Before you start a review:

- Read the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and ensure that you abide by it at all times.
- Be polite, considerate, and helpful.
- Comment on positive aspects of PRs as well as changes.
- Be empathetic and mindful of how your review may be received.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions.
- Experienced contributors, consider pairing with new contributors whose work requires extensive changes.

## Review process

In general, review pull requests for content and style in English.

1.  Go to
    [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls).
    You see a list of every open pull request against the Kubernetes website and
    docs.

2.  Filter the open PRs using one or all of the following labels:
    - `cncf-cla: yes` (Recommended): PRs submitted by contributors who have not signed the CLA cannot be merged. See [Sign the CLA](/docs/contribute/new-content/overview/#sign-the-cla) for more information.
    - `language/en` (Recommended): Filters for english language PRs only.
    - `size/<size>`: filters for PRs of a certain size. If you're new, start with smaller PRs.

    Additionally, ensure the PR isn't marked as a work in progress. PRs using the `work in progress` label are not ready for review yet.

3.  Once you've selected a PR to review, understand the change by:
    - Reading the PR description to understand the changes made, and read any linked issues
    - Reading any comments by other reviewers
    - Clicking the **Files changed** tab to see the files and lines changed
    - Previewing the changes in the Netlify preview build by scrolling to the PR's build check section at the bottom of the **Conversation** tab and clicking the **deploy/netlify** line's **Details** link.

4.  Go to the **Files changed** tab to start your review.
    1. Click on the `+` symbol  beside the line you want to comment on.
    2. Fill in any comments you have about the line and click either **Add single comment** (if you have only one comment to make) or  **Start a review** (if you have multiple comments to make).
    3. When finished, click **Review changes** at the top of the page. Here, you can add
       add a summary of your review (and leave some positive comments for the contributor!),
      approve the PR, comment or request changes as needed. New contributors should always
      choose **Comment**.

## Reviewing checklist

When reviewing, use the following as a starting point.

### Language and grammar

- Are there any obvious errors in language or grammar? Is there a better way to phrase something?
- Are there any complicated or archaic words which could be replaced with a simpler word?
- Are there any words, terms or phrases in use which could be replaced with a non-discriminatory alternative?
- Does the word choice and its capitalization follow the [style guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/)?
- Are there long sentences which could be shorter or less complex?
- Are there any long paragraphs which might work better as a list or table?

### Content

- Does similar content exist elsewhere on the Kubernetes site?
- Does the content excessively link to off-site, individual vendor or non-open source documentation?

### Website

- Did this PR change or remove a page title, slug/alias or anchor link? If so, are there broken links as a result of this PR? Is there another option, like changing the page title without changing the slug?
- Does the PR introduce a new page? If so:
  - Is the page using the right [page template](/docs/contribute/style/page-templates/) and associated Hugo shortcodes?
  - Does the page appear correctly in the section's side navigation (or at all)?
  - Should the page appear on the [Docs Home](/docs/home/) listing?
- Do the changes show up in the Netlify preview? Be particularly vigilant about lists, code blocks, tables, notes and images.

### Other

For small issues with a PR, like typos or whitespace, prefix your comments with `nit:`.  This lets the author know the issue is non-critical.
