{{% capture overview %}}

This page shows you how to [localize](https://blog.mozilla.org/l10n/2011/12/14/i18n-vs-l10n-whats-the-diff/) the docs for a different language.

## Getting started

Because contributors can't approve their own pull requests, you need at least two contributors to begin a localization.

All localization teams must be self-sustaining with their own resources. The Kubernetes website is happy to host your work, but it's up to you to translate it.

### Find your two-letter language code

First, consult the [ISO 639-1 standard](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) to find your localization's two-letter country code. For example, the two-letter code for Korean is `ko`.

### Fork and clone the repo

First, [create your own fork](/docs/contribute/new-content/new-content/#fork-the-repo) of the [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) repository.

Then, clone your fork and `cd` into it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<username>/website
cd website
```

### Open a pull request

Next, [open a pull request](/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/#open-a-pr) (PR) to add a localization to the `kubernetes/website` repository.

The PR must include all of the [minimum required content](#minimum-required-content) before it can be approved.

For an example of adding a new localization, see the PR to enable [docs in French](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/12548).

### Join the Kubernetes GitHub organization

Once you've opened a localization PR, you can become members of the Kubernetes GitHub organization. Each person on the team needs to create their own [Organization Membership Request](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/new/choose) in the `kubernetes/org` repository.

### Add your localization team in GitHub

Next, add your Kubernetes localization team to [`sig-docs/teams.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/blob/master/config/kubernetes/sig-docs/teams.yaml). For an example of adding a localization team, see the PR to add the [Spanish localization team](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/685).

Members of `@kubernetes/sig-docs-**-owners` can approve PRs that change content within (and only within) your localization directory: `/content/**/`.

For each localization, The `@kubernetes/sig-docs-**-reviews` team automates review assignment for new PRs.

Members of `@kubernetes/website-maintainers` can create new development branches to coordinate translation efforts.

Members of `@kubernetes/website-milestone-maintainers` can use the `/milestone` [Prow command](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help) to assign a milestone to issues or PRs.

### Configure the workflow

Next, add a GitHub label for your localization in the `kubernetes/test-infra` repository. A label lets you filter issues and pull requests for your specific language.

For an example of adding a label, see the PR for adding the [Italian language label](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/11316).

### Find community

Let Kubernetes SIG Docs know you're interested in creating a localization! Join the [SIG Docs Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C1J0BPD2M/). Other localization teams are happy to help you get started and answer any questions you have.

You can also create a Slack channel for your localization in the `kubernetes/community` repository. For an example of adding a Slack channel, see the PR for [adding channels for Indonesian and Portuguese](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/3605).

## Minimum required content

### Modify the site configuration

The Kubernetes website uses Hugo as its web framework. The website's Hugo configuration resides in the  [`config.toml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/config.toml) file. To support a new localization, you'll need to modify `config.toml`.

Add a configuration block for the new language to `config.toml`, under the existing `[languages]` block. The German block, for example, looks like:

```toml
[languages.de]
title = "Kubernetes"
description = "Produktionsreife Container-Verwaltung"
languageName = "Deutsch"
contentDir = "content/de"
weight = 3
```

When assigning a `weight` parameter for your block, find the language block with the highest weight and add 1 to that value.

For more information about Hugo's multilingual support, see "[Multilingual Mode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/)".

### Add a new localization directory

Add a language-specific subdirectory to the [`content`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/content) folder in the repository. For example, the two-letter code for German is `de`:

```shell
mkdir content/de
```

### Localize the community code of conduct

Open a PR against the [`cncf/foundation`](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/tree/master/code-of-conduct-languages) repository to add the code of conduct in your language.

### Add a localized README file

To guide other localization contributors, add a new [`README-**.md`](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/) to the top level of k/website, where `**` is the two-letter language code. For example, a German README file would be `README-de.md`.

Provide guidance to localization contributors in the localized `README-**.md` file. Include the same information contained in `README.md` as well as:

- A point of contact for the localization project
- Any information specific to the localization

After you create the localized README, add a link to the file from the main English `README.md`, and include contact information in English. You can provide a GitHub ID, email address, [Slack channel](https://slack.com/), or other method of contact. You must also provide a link to your localized Community Code of Conduct.

### Setting up the OWNERS files

To set the roles of each user contributing to the localization, create an `OWNERS` file inside the language-specific subdirectory with:

- **reviewers**: A list of kubernetes teams with reviewer roles, in this case, the `sig-docs-**-reviews` team created in [Add your localization team in GitHub](#add-your-localization-team-in-github).
- **approvers**: A list of kubernetes teams with approvers roles, in this case, the `sig-docs-**-owners` team created in [Add your localization team in GitHub](#add-your-localization-team-in-github).
- **labels**: A list of GitHub labels to automatically apply to a PR, in this case, the language label created in [Configure the workflow](#configure-the-workflow).

More information about the `OWNERS` file can be found at [go.k8s.io/owners](https://go.k8s.io/owners).

The [Spanish OWNERS file](https://git.k8s.io/website/content/es/OWNERS), with language code `es`, looks like:

```yaml
# See the OWNERS docs at https://go.k8s.io/owners

# This is the localization project for Spanish.
# Teams and members are visible at https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams.

reviewers:
- sig-docs-es-reviews

approvers:
- sig-docs-es-owners

labels:
- language/es
```

After adding the language-specific `OWNERS` file, update the [root `OWNERS_ALIASES`](https://git.k8s.io/website/OWNERS_ALIASES) file with the new Kubernetes teams for the localization, `sig-docs-**-owners` and `sig-docs-**-reviews`.

For each team, add the list of GitHub users requested in [Add your localization team in GitHub](#add-your-localization-team-in-github), in alphabetical order.

## Translating content

Localizing *all* of the Kubernetes documentation is an enormous task. It's okay to start small and expand over time.

At a minimum, all localizations must include:

Description | URLs
-----|-----
Home | [All heading and subheading URLs](/docs/home/)
Setup | [All heading and subheading URLs](/docs/setup/)
Tutorials | [Kubernetes Basics](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/), [Hello Minikube](/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/hello-minikube/)
Site strings | [All site strings in a new localized TOML file](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/i18n)

Translated documents must reside in their own `content/**/` subdirectory, but otherwise follow the same URL path as the English source. For example, to prepare the [Kubernetes Basics](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) tutorial for translation into German, create a subfolder under the `content/de/` folder and copy the English source:

```shell
mkdir -p content/de/docs/tutorials
cp content/en/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics.md content/de/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics.md
```

Translation tools can speed up the translation process. For example, some editors offers plugins to quickly translate text.

{{< caution >}}
Machine-generated translation is insufficient on its own. Localization requires extensive human review to meet minimum standards of quality.
{{< /caution >}}

To ensure accuracy in grammar and meaning, members of your localization team should carefully review all machine-generated translations before publishing.

### Source files

Localizations must be based on the English files from the most recent release, {{< latest-version >}}.

To find source files for the most recent release:

1. Navigate to the Kubernetes website repository at https://github.com/kubernetes/website.
2. Select the `release-1.X` branch for the most recent version.

The latest version is {{< latest-version >}}, so the most recent release branch is [`{{< release-branch >}}`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/{{< release-branch >}}).

### Site strings in i18n

Localizations must include the contents of [`i18n/en.toml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/i18n/en.toml) in a new language-specific file. Using German as an example: `i18n/de.toml`.

Add a new localization file to `i18n/`. For example, with German (`de`):

```shell
cp i18n/en.toml i18n/de.toml
```

Then translate the value of each string:

```TOML
[docs_label_i_am]
other = "ICH BIN..."
```

Localizing site strings lets you customize site-wide text and features: for example, the legal copyright text in the footer on each page.

### Language specific style guide and glossary

Some language teams have their own language-specific style guide and glossary. For example, see the [Korean Localization Guide](/ko/docs/contribute/localization_ko/).

## Branching strategy

Because localization projects are highly collaborative efforts, we encourage teams to work in shared development branches.

To collaborate on a development branch:

1. A team member of [@kubernetes/website-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/website-maintainers) opens a development branch from a source branch on https://github.com/kubernetes/website.

    Your team approvers joined the `@kubernetes/website-maintainers` team when you [added your localization team](#add-your-localization-team-in-github) to the [`kubernetes/org`](https://github.com/kubernetes/org) repository.

    We recommend the following branch naming scheme:

    `dev-<source version>-<language code>.<team milestone>`

    For example, an approver on a German localization team opens the development branch `dev-1.12-de.1` directly against the k/website repository, based on the source branch for Kubernetes v1.12.

2. Individual contributors open feature branches based on the development branch.

    For example, a German contributor opens a pull request with changes to `kubernetes:dev-1.12-de.1` from `username:local-branch-name`.

3. Approvers review and merge feature branches into the development branch.

4. Periodically, an approver merges the development branch to its source branch by opening and approving a new pull request. Be sure to squash the commits before approving the pull request.

Repeat steps 1-4 as needed until the localization is complete. For example, subsequent German development branches would be: `dev-1.12-de.2`, `dev-1.12-de.3`, etc.

Teams must merge localized content into the same release branch from which the content was sourced. For example, a development branch sourced from {{< release-branch >}} must be based on {{< release-branch >}}.

An approver must maintain a development branch by keeping it current with its source branch and resolving merge conflicts. The longer a development branch stays open, the more maintenance it typically requires. Consider periodically merging development branches and opening new ones, rather than maintaining one extremely long-running development branch.

At the beginning of every team milestone, it's helpful to open an issue [comparing upstream changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/scripts/upstream_changes.py) between the previous development branch and the current development branch.

 While only approvers can open a new development branch and merge pull requests, anyone can open a pull request for a new development branch. No special permissions are required.

For more information about working from forks or directly from the repository, see ["fork and clone the repo"](#fork-and-clone-the-repo).

## Upstream contributions

SIG Docs welcomes upstream contributions and corrections to the English source.

## Help an existing localization

You can also help add or improve content to an existing localization. Join the [Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C1J0BPD2M/) for the localization, and start opening PRs to help. Please limit pull requests to a single localization since pull requests that change content in multiple localizations could be difficult to review.

Once a localization meets requirements for workflow and minimum output, SIG docs will:

- Enable language selection on the website
- Publicize the localization's availability through [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/about/) (CNCF) channels, including the [Kubernetes blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/).
