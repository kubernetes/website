{{% capture overview %}}

This page assumes that you've read and mastered the tasks in the
[start contributing](/docs/contribute/start/) topic and are ready to
learn about more ways to contribute.

{{< note >}}
Some tasks require you to use the Git command line client and other tools.
{{< /note >}}

{{% /capture %}}

{{% capture body %}}

Now that you've gotten your feet wet and helped out with the Kubernetes docs in
the ways outlined in the [start contributing](/docs/contribute/start/) topic,
you may feel ready to do more. These tasks assume that you have, or are willing
to gain, deeper knowledge of the following topic areas:

- Kubernetes concepts
- Kubernetes documentation workflows
- Where and how to find information about upcoming Kubernetes features
- Strong research skills in general

These tasks are not as sequential as the beginner tasks. There is no expectation
that one person does all of them all of the time.

## Learn about Prow

[Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/prow/README.md) is
the Kubernetes-based CI/CD system that runs jobs against pull requests (PRs). Prow
enables chatbot-style commands to handle GitHub actions across the Kubernetes
organization. You can perform a variety of actions such as [adding and removing
labels](#add-and-remove-labels), closing issues, and assigning an approver. Type
the Prow command into a comment field using the `/<command-name>` format. Some common
commands are:

- `/lgtm` (looks good to me): adds the `lgtm` label, signalling that a reviewer has finished reviewing the PR
- `/approve`: approves a PR so it can merge (approver use only)
- `/assign`: assigns a person to review or approve a PR
- `/close`: closes an issue or PR
- `/hold`: adds the `do-not-merge/hold` label, indicating the PR cannot be automatically merged
- `/hold cancel`: removes the `do-not-merge/hold` label

{{% note %}}
Not all commands are available to every user. The Prow bot will tell you if you
try to execute a command beyond your authorization level.
{{% /note %}}

Familiarize yourself with the [list of Prow
commands](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help) before you review PRs or triage issues.


## Review pull requests

In any given week, a specific docs approver volunteers to do initial triage
and review of [pull requests and issues](#triage-and-categorize-issues). This
person is the "PR Wrangler" for the week. The schedule is maintained using the
[PR Wrangler scheduler](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/PR-Wranglers).
To be added to this list, attend the weekly SIG Docs meeting and volunteer. Even
if you are not on the schedule for the current week, you can still review pull
requests (PRs) that are not already under active review.

In addition to the rotation, an automated system comments on each new PR and
suggests reviewers and approvers for the PR, based on the list of approvers and
reviewers in the affected files. The PR author is expected to follow the
guidance of the bot, and this also helps PRs to get reviewed quickly.

We want to get pull requests (PRs) merged and published as quickly as possible.
To ensure the docs are accurate and up to date, each PR needs to be reviewed by
people who understand the content, as well as people with experience writing
great documentation.

Reviewers and approvers need to provide actionable and constructive feedback to
keep contributors engaged and help them to improve. Sometimes helping a new
contributor get their PR ready to merge takes more time than just rewriting it
yourself, but the project is better in the long term when we have a diversity of
active participants.

Before you start reviewing PRs, make sure you are familiar with the
[Documentation Content Guide](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/), the
[Documentation Style Guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/),
and the [code of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct/).

### Find a PR to review

To see all open PRs, go to the **Pull Requests** tab in the GitHub repository.
A PR is eligible for review when it meets all of the following criteria:

- Has the `cncf-cla:yes` tag
- Does not have WIP in the description
- Does not a have tag including the phrase `do-not-merge`
- Has no merge conflicts
- Is based against the correct branch (usually `master` unless the PR relates to
  a feature that has not yet been released)
- Is not being actively reviewed by another docs person (other technical
  reviewers are fine), unless that person has explicitly asked for your help. In
  particular, leaving lots of new comments after other review cycles have
  already been completed on a PR can be discouraging and counter-productive.

If a PR is not eligible to merge, leave a comment to let the author know about
the problem and offer to help them fix it. If they've been informed and have not
fixed the problem in several weeks or months, eventually their PR will be closed
without merging.

If you're new to reviewing, or you don't have a lot of bandwidth, look for PRs
with the `size/XS` or `size/S` tag set. The size is automatically determined by
the number of lines the PR changes.

#### Reviewers and approvers

The Kubernetes website repo operates differently than some of the Kubernetes
code repositories when it comes to the roles of reviewers and approvers. For
more information about the responsibilities of reviewers and approvers, see
[Participating](/docs/contribute/participating/). Here's an overview.

- A reviewer reviews pull request content for technical accuracy. A reviewer
  indicates that a PR is technically accurate by leaving a `/lgtm` comment on
  the PR.

    {{< note >}}Don't add a `/lgtm` unless you are confident in the technical
    accuracy of the documentation modified or introduced in the PR.{{< /note >}}

- An approver reviews pull request content for docs quality and adherence to
  SIG Docs guidelines found in the Content and Style guides. Only people listed as
  approvers in the
  [`OWNERS`](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS) file can
  approve a PR. To approve a PR, leave an `/approve` comment on the PR.

A PR is merged when it has both a `/lgtm` comment from anyone in the Kubernetes
organization and an `/approve` comment from an approver in the
`sig-docs-maintainers` group, as long as it is not on hold and the PR author
has signed the CLA.

{{< note >}}

The ["Participating"](/docs/contribute/participating/#approvers) section contains more information for reviewers and approvers, including specific responsibilities for approvers.

### Review a PR

1.  Read the PR description and read any attached issues or links, if
    applicable. "Drive-by reviewing" is sometimes more harmful than helpful, so
    make sure you have the right knowledge to provide a meaningful review.

2.  If someone else is the best person to review this particular PR, let them
    know by adding a comment with `/assign @<github-username>`. If you have
    asked a non-docs person for technical review but still want to review the PR
    from a docs point of view, keep going.

3.  Go to the **Files changed** tab. Look over all the changed lines. Removed
    content has a red background, and those lines also start with a `-` symbol.
    Added content has a green background, and those lines also start with a `+`
    symbol. Within a line, the actual modified content has a slightly darker
    green background than the rest of the line.

      - Especially if the PR uses tricky formatting or changes CSS, Javascript,
        or other site-wide elements, you can preview the website with the PR
        applied. Go to the **Conversation** tab and click the **Details** link
        for the `deploy/netlify` test, near the bottom of the page. It opens in
        the same browser window by default, so open it in a new window so you
        don't lose your partial review. Switch back to the **Files changed** tab
        to resume your review.
      - Make sure the PR complies with the Content and Style guides; link the
        author to the relevant part of the guide(s) if it doesn't.
      - If you have a question, comment, or other feedback about a given
        change, hover over a line and click the blue-and-white `+` symbol that
        appears. Type your comment and click **Start a review**.
      - If you have more comments, leave them in the same way.
      - By convention, if you see a small problem that does not have to do with
        the main purpose of the PR, such as a typo or whitespace error, you can
        call it out, prefixing your comment with `nit:` so that the author knows
        you consider it trivial. They should still address it.
      - When you've reviewed everything, or if you didn't have any comments, go
        back to the top of the page and click **Review changes**. Choose either
        **Comment** or **Request Changes**. Add a summary of your review, and
        add appropriate
        [Prow commands](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help) to separate lines in
        the Review Summary field. SIG Docs follows the
        [Kubernetes code review process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md#the-code-review-process).
        All of your comments will be sent to the PR author in a single
        notification.

          - If you think the PR is ready to be merged, add the text `/approve` to
            your summary.
          - If the PR does not need additional technical review, add the
            text `/lgtm` as well.
          - If the PR *does* need additional technical review, add the text
            `/assign` with the GitHub username of the person who needs to
            provide technical review. Look at the `reviewers` field in the
            front-matter at the top of a given Markdown file to see who can
            provide technical review.
          - To prevent the PR from being merged, add `/hold`. This sets the
            label `do-not-merge/hold`.
          - If a PR has no conflicts and has the `lgtm` and `approve` labels but
            no `hold` label, it is merged automatically.
          - If a PR has the `lgtm` and/or `approve` labels and new changes are
            detected, these labels are removed automatically.

            See
            [the list of all available slash commands](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help)
            that can be used in PRs.

    - If you previously selected **Request changes** and the PR author has
      addressed your concerns, you can change your review status either in the
      **Files changed** tab or at the bottom of the **Conversation** tab. Be
      sure to add the `/approve` tag and assign technical reviewers if necessary,
      so that the PR can be merged.

### Commit into another person's PR

Leaving PR comments is helpful, but there may be times when you need to commit
into another person's PR, rather than just leaving a review.

Resist the urge to "take over" for another person unless they explicitly ask
you to, or you want to resurrect a long-abandoned PR. While it may be faster
in the short term, it deprives the person of the chance to contribute.

The process you use depends on whether you need to edit a file that is already
in the scope of the PR or a file that the PR has not yet touched.

You can't commit into someone else's PR if either of the following things is
true:

- If the PR author pushed their branch directly to the
  [https://github.com/kubernetes/website/](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/)
  repository, only a reviewer with push access can commit into their PR.
  Authors should be encouraged to push their branch to their fork before
  opening the PR.
- If the PR author explicitly disallowed edits from approvers, you can't
  commit into their PR unless they change this setting.

#### If the file is already changed by the PR

This method uses the GitHub UI. If you prefer, you can use the command line
even if the file you want to change is part of the PR, if you are more
comfortable working that way.

1.  Click the **Files changed** tab.
2.  Scroll down to the file you want to edit, and click the pencil icon for
    that file.
3.  Make your changes, add a commit message in the field below the editor, and
    click **Commit changes**.

Your commit is now pushed to the branch the PR represents (probably on the
author's fork) and now shows up in the PR and your changes are reflected in
the **Files changed** tab. Leave a comment letting the PR author know you
changed the PR.

If the author is using the command line rather than the GitHub UI to work on
this PR, they need to fetch their fork's changes and rebase their local branch
on the branch in their fork, before doing additional work on the PR.

#### If the file has not yet been changed by the PR

If changes need to be made to a file that is not yet included in the PR, you
need to use the command line. You can always use this method, if you prefer it
to the GitHub UI.

1.  Get the URL for the author's fork. You can find it near the bottom of the
    **Conversation** tab. Look for the text **Add more commits by pushing to**.
    The first link after this phrase is to the branch, and the second link is
    to the fork. Copy the second link. Note the name of the branch for later.

2.  Add the fork as a remote. In your terminal, go to your clone of the
    repository. Decide on a name to give the remote (such as the author's
    GitHub username), and add the remote using the following syntax:

      ```bash
      git remote add <name> <url-of-fork>
      ```

3.  Fetch the remote. This doesn't change any local files, but updates your
    clone's notion of the remote's objects (such as branches and tags) and
    their current state.

      ```bash
      git remote fetch <name>
      ```

4.  Check out the remote branch. This command will fail if you already have a
    local branch with the same name.

      ```bash
      git checkout <branch-from-PR>
      ```

5.  Make your changes, use `git add` to add them, and commit them.

6.  Push your changes to the author's remote.

      ```bash
      git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
      ```

7.  Go back to the GitHub IU and refresh the PR. Your changes appear. Leave the
    PR author a comment letting them know you changed the PR.

If the author is using the command line rather than the GitHub UI to work on
this PR, they need to fetch their fork's changes and rebase their local branch
on the branch in their fork, before doing additional work on the PR.

## Work from a local clone

For changes that require multiple files or changes that involve creating new
files or moving files around, working from a local Git clone makes more sense
than relying on the GitHub UI. These instructions use the `git` command and
assume that you have it installed locally. You can adapt them to use a local
graphical Git client instead.

### Clone the repository

You only need to clone the repository once per physical system where you work
on the Kubernetes documentation.

1.  Create a fork of the `kubernetes/website` repository on GitHub. In your
    web browser, go to
    [https://github.com/kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website)
    and click the **Fork** button. After a few seconds, you are redirected to
    the URL for your fork, which is `https://github.com/<github_username>/website`.

2.  In a terminal window, use `git clone` to clone the your fork.

      ```bash
      git clone git@github.com/<github_username>/website
      ```

      The new directory `website` is created in your current directory, with
      the contents of your GitHub repository. Your fork is your `origin`.

3.  Change to the new `website` directory. Set the `kubernetes/website` repository as the `upstream` remote.

      ```bash
      cd website

      git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
      ```

4.  Confirm your `origin` and `upstream` repositories.

    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

    Output is similar to:

    ```bash
    origin	git@github.com:<github_username>/website.git (fetch)
    origin	git@github.com:<github_username>/website.git (push)
    upstream	https://github.com/kubernetes/website (fetch)
    upstream	https://github.com/kubernetes/website (push)
    ```

### Work on the local repository

Before you start a new unit of work on your local repository, you need to figure
out which branch to base your work on. The answer depends on what you are doing,
but the following guidelines apply:

- For general improvements to existing content, start from `master`.
- For new content that is about features that already exist in a released
  version of Kubernetes, start from `master`.
- For long-running efforts that multiple SIG Docs contributors will collaborate on,
  such as content reorganization, use a specific feature branch created for that
  effort.
- For new content that relates to upcoming but unreleased Kubernetes versions,
  use the pre-release feature branch created for that Kubernetes version.

For more guidance, see
[Choose which branch to use](/docs/contribute/start/#choose-which-git-branch-to-use).

After you decide which branch to start your work (or _base it on_, in Git
terminology), use the following workflow to be sure your work is based on the
most up-to-date version of that branch.

1.  There are three different copies of the repository when you work locally:
    `local`, `upstream`, and `origin`. Fetch both the `origin` and `upstream` remotes. This
    updates your cache of the remotes without actually changing any of the copies.

      ```bash
      git fetch origin
      git fetch upstream
      ```

    This workflow deviates from the one defined in the Community's [GitHub
    Workflow](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md).
    In this workflow, you do not need to merge your local copy of `master` with `upstream/master` before
    pushing the updates to your fork. That step is not required in
    `kubernetes/website` because you are basing your branch on the upstream repository.

2.  Create a local working branch based on the most appropriate upstream branch:
    `upstream/dev-1.xx` for feature developers or `upstream/master` for all other
    contributors. This example assumes you are basing your work on
    `upstream/master`. Because you didn't update your local `master` to match
    `upstream/master` in the previous step, you need to explicitly create your
    branch off of `upstream/master`.

      ```bash
      git checkout -b <my_new_branch> upstream/master
      ```

3.  With your new branch checked out, make your changes using a text editor.
    At any time, use the `git status` command to see what you've changed.

4.  When you are ready to submit a pull request, commit your changes. First
    use `git status` to see what changes need to be added to the changeset.
    There are two important sections: `Changes staged for commit` and
    `Changes not staged for commit`. Any files that show up in the latter
    section under `modified` or `untracked` need to be added if you want them to
    be part of this commit. For each file that needs to be added, use `git add`.

      ```bash
      git add example-file.md
      ```

      When all your intended changes are included, create a commit using the
      `git commit` command:

      ```bash
      git commit -m "Your commit message"
      ```

      {{< note >}}
      Do not reference a GitHub issue or pull request by ID or URL in the
      commit message. If you do, it will cause that issue or pull request to get
      a notification every time the commit shows up in a new Git branch. You can
      link issues and pull requests together later in the GitHub UI.
      {{< /note >}}

5.  Optionally, you can test your change by staging the site locally using the
    `hugo` command. See [View your changes locally](#view-your-changes-locally).
    You'll be able to view your changes after you submit the pull request, as
    well.

6.  Before you can create a pull request which includes your local commit, you
    need to push the branch to your fork, which is the endpoint for the `origin`
    remote.

      ```bash
      git push origin <my_new_branch>
      ```

      Technically, you can omit the branch name from the `push` command, but
      the behavior in that case depends upon the version of Git you are using.
      The results are more repeatable if you include the branch name.

7.  Go to https://github.com/kubernetes/website in your web browser. GitHub
    detects that you pushed a new branch to your fork and offers to create a pull
    request. Fill in the pull request template.

      - The title should be no more than 50 characters and summarize the intent
        of the change.
      - The long-form description should contain more information about the fix,
        including a line like `Fixes #12345` if the pull request fixes a GitHub
        issue. This will cause the issue to be closed automatically when the
        pull request is merged.
      - You can add labels or other metadata and assign reviewers. See
        [Triage and categorize issues](#triage-and-categorize-issues) for the
        syntax.

      Click **Create pull request**.

8.  Several automated tests will run against the state of the website with your
    changes applied. If any of the tests fail, click the **Details** link for
    more information. If the Netlify test completes successfully, its
    **Details** link goes to a staged version of the Kubernetes website with
    your changes applied. This is how reviewers will check your changes.

9.  When you need to make more changes, address the feedback locally and amend
    your original commit.

    ```bash
    git commit -a --amend
    ```

    - `-a`: commit all changes
    - `--amend`: amend the previous commit, rather than creating a new one

    An editor will open so you can update your commit message if necessary.

    If you use `git commit -m` as in Step 4, you will create a new commit rather
    than amending changes to your original commit. Creating a new commit means
    you must squash your commits before your pull request can be merged.

    Follow the instructions in Step 6 to push your commit. The commit is added
    to your pull request and the tests run again, including re-staging the
    Netlify staged site.

10. If a reviewer adds changes to your pull request, you need to fetch those
    changes from your fork before you can add more changes. Use the following
    commands to do this, assuming that your branch is currently checked out.

      ```bash
      git fetch origin
      git rebase origin/<your-branch-name>
      ```

      After rebasing, you need to add the `--force-with-lease` flag to
      force push the branch's new changes to your fork.

      ```bash
      git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
      ```

11. If someone else's change is merged into the branch your work is based on,
    and you have made changes to the same parts of the same files, a conflict
    might occur. If the pull request shows that there are conflicts to resolve,
    you can resolve them using the GitHub UI or you can resolve them locally.

      First, do step 10 to be sure that your fork and your local branch are in
      the same state.

      Next, fetch `upstream` and rebase your branch on the branch it was
      originally based on, like `upstream/master`.

      ```bash
      git fetch upstream
      git rebase upstream/master
      ```

      If there are conflicts Git can't automatically resolve, you can see the
      conflicted files using the `git status` command. For each conflicted file,
      edit it and look for the conflict markers `>>>`, `<<<`, and `===`. Resolve
      the conflict and remove the conflict markers. Then add the changes to the
      changeset using `git add <filename>` and continue the rebase using
      `git rebase --continue`. When all commits have been applied and there are
      no more conflicts, `git status` will show that you are not in a rebase and
      there are no changes that need to be committed. At that point, force-push
      the branch to your fork, and the pull request should no longer show any
      conflicts.

12. If your PR still has multiple commits after amending previous commits, you
    must squash multiple commits into a single commit before your PR can be merged.
    You can check the number of commits on your PR's `Commits` tab or by running
    `git log` locally. Squashing commits is a form of rebasing.

    ```bash
    git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits>
    ```  

    The `-i` switch tells git you want to rebase interactively. This enables
    you to tell git which commits to squash into the first one. For
    example, you have 3 commits on your branch:

    ```
    12345 commit 4 (2 minutes ago)
    6789d commit 3 (30 minutes ago)
    456df commit 2 (1 day ago)     
    ```

    You must squash your last three commits into the first one.

    ```
    git rebase -i HEAD~3
    ```

    That command opens an editor with the following:

    ```
    pick 456df commit 2
    pick 6789d commit 3
    pick 12345 commit 4
    ```

    Change `pick` to `squash` on the commits you want to squash, and make sure
    the one `pick` commit is at the top of the editor.

    ```
    pick 456df commit 2
    squash 6789d commit 3
    squash 12345 commit 4
    ```

    Save and close your editor. Then push your squashed
    commit with `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch_name>`.


If you're having trouble resolving conflicts or you get stuck with
anything else related to your pull request, ask for help on the `#sig-docs`
Slack channel or the
[kubernetes-sig-docs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs).

### View your changes locally

{{< tabs name="tab_with_hugo" >}}
{{% tab name="Hugo in a container" %}}

If you aren't ready to create a pull request but you want to see what your
changes look like, you can build and run a docker image to generate all the documentation and
serve it locally.

1.  Build the image locally:

      ```bash
      make docker-image
      ```

2.  Once the `kubernetes-hugo` image has been built locally, you can build and serve the site:

      ```bash
      make docker-serve
      ```

3.  In your browser's address bar, enter `localhost:1313`. Hugo will watch the
    filesystem for changes and rebuild the site as needed.

4.  To stop the local Hugo instance, go back to the terminal and type `Ctrl+C`
    or just close the terminal window.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Hugo locally" %}}

Alternatively, you can install and use the `hugo` command on your development machine:

1.  Install the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) version specified in [`website/netlify.toml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/master/netlify.toml).

2.  In a terminal, go to the root directory of your clone of the Kubernetes
    docs, and enter this command:

      ```bash

## Triage and categorize issues

People in SIG Docs are responsible only for triaging and categorizing
documentation issues. General website issues are also filed in the
`kubernetes/website` repository.

When you triage an issue, you:

- Validate the issue
    - Make sure the issue is about website documentation. Some issues can be closed quickly by
      answering a question or pointing the reporter to a resource. See the
      [Support requests or code bug reports](#support-requests-or-code-bug-reports) section for details.
    - Assess whether the issue has merit. Add the `triage/needs-information` label if the issue doesn't have enough
      detail to be actionable or the template is not filled out adequately.
      Close the issue if it has both the `lifecycle/stale` and `triage/needs-information` labels.
- Add a priority label (the
  [Issue Triage Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md#define-priority)
  define Priority labels in detail)
    - `priority/critical-urgent` - do this right now
    - `priority/important-soon` - do this within 3 months
    - `priority/important-longterm` - do this within 6 months
    - `priority/backlog` - this can be deferred indefinitely; lowest priority;
      do this when resources are available
    - `priority/awaiting-more-evidence` - placeholder for a potentially good issue
       so it doesn't get lost
- Optionally, add a `help` or `good first issue` label if the issue is suitable
  for someone with very little Kubernetes or SIG Docs experience. Consult
  [Help Wanted and Good First Issue Labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/help-wanted.md)
  for guidance.
- At your discretion, take ownership of an issue and submit a PR for it
  (especially if it is quick or relates to work you were already doing).

This GitHub Issue [filter](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3Apriority%2Fbacklog+-label%3Apriority%2Fimportant-longterm+-label%3Apriority%2Fimportant-soon+-label%3Atriage%2Fneeds-information+-label%3Atriage%2Fsupport+sort%3Acreated-asc)
finds all the issues that need to be triaged.

If you have questions about triaging an issue, ask in `#sig-docs` on Slack or
the [kubernetes-sig-docs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs).

### Add and remove labels

To add a label, leave a comment like `/<label-to-add>` or `/<label-category> <label-to-add>`. The label must
already exist. If you try to add a label that does not exist, the command is
silently ignored.

Examples:

- `/triage needs-information`
- `/priority important-soon`
- `/language ja`
- `/help`
- `/good-first-issue`
- `/lifecycle frozen`

To remove a label, leave a comment like `/remove-<label-to-remove>` or `/remove-<label-category> <label-to-remove>`.

Examples:

- `/remove-triage needs-information`
- `/remove-priority important-soon`
- `/remove-language ja`
- `/remove-help`
- `/remove-good-first-issue`
- `/remove-lifecycle frozen`

The list of all the labels used across Kubernetes is
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels). Not all labels
are used by SIG Docs.

### More about labels

- An issue can have multiple labels.
- Some labels use slash notation for grouping, which can be thought of like
  "sub-labels". For instance, many `sig/` labels exist, such as `sig/cli` and
  `sig/api-machinery` ([full list](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sig%2F)).
- Some labels are automatically added based on metadata in the files involved
  in the issue, slash commands used in the comments of the issue, or
  information in the issue text.
- Additional labels are manually added by the person triaging the issue (or the person
  reporting the issue)
  - `kind/bug`, `kind/feature`, and `kind/documentation`: A bug is a problem with existing content or
    functionality, and a feature is a request for new content or functionality.
    The `kind/documentation` label is seldom used.
  - `language/ja`, `language/ko` and similar [language
    labels](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/labels?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language)
    if the issue is about localized content.

### Issue lifecycle

Issues are generally opened and closed within a relatively short time span.
However, sometimes an issue may not have associated activity after it is
created. Other times, an issue may need to remain open for longer than 90 days.

`lifecycle/stale`: after 90 days with no activity, an issue is automatically
labeled as stale. The issue will be automatically closed if the lifecycle is not
manually reverted using the `/remove-lifecycle stale` command.

`lifecycle/frozen`: an issue with this label will not become stale after 90 days
of inactivity. A user manually adds this label to issues that need to remain
open for much longer than 90 days, such as those with a
`priority/important-longterm` label.


### Handling special issue types

We encounter the following types of issues often enough to document how
to handle them.

#### Duplicate issues

If a single problem has one or more issues open for it, the problem should be
consolidated into a single issue. You should decide which issue to keep open (or
open a new issue), port over all relevant information and link related issues.
Finally, label all other issues that describe the same problem with
`triage/duplicate` and close them. Only having a single issue to work on will
help reduce confusion and avoid duplicating work on the same problem.

#### Dead link issues

Depending on where the dead link is reported, different actions are required to
resolve the issue. Dead links in the API and Kubectl docs are automation issues
and should be assigned `/priority critical-urgent` until the problem can be fully understood. All other
dead links are issues that need to be manually fixed and can be assigned `/priority important-longterm`.

#### Blog issues

[Kubernetes Blog](https://kubernetes.io/blog/) entries are expected to become
outdated over time, so we maintain only blog entries that are less than one year old.
If an issue is related to a blog entry that is more than one year old, it should be closed
without fixing.

#### Support requests or code bug reports

Some issues opened for docs are instead issues with the underlying code, or
requests for assistance when something (like a tutorial) didn’t work. For issues
unrelated to docs, close the issue with the `triage/support` label and a comment
directing the requester to support venues (Slack, Stack Overflow) and, if
relevant, where to file an issue for bugs with features (kubernetes/kubernetes
is a great place to start).

Sample response to a request for support:

```none
This issue sounds more like a request for support and less
like an issue specifically for docs. I encourage you to bring
your question to the `#kubernetes-users` channel in
[Kubernetes slack](http://slack.k8s.io/). You can also search
resources like
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kubernetes)
for answers to similar questions.

You can also open issues for Kubernetes functionality in
 https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.

If this is a documentation issue, please re-open this issue.
```

Sample code bug report response:

```none
This sounds more like an issue with the code than an issue with
the documentation. Please open an issue at
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues.

If this is a documentation issue, please re-open this issue.
```

## Document new features

Each major Kubernetes release includes new features, and many of them need
at least a small amount of documentation to show people how to use them.

Often, the SIG responsible for a feature submits draft documentation for the
feature as a pull request to the appropriate release branch of
`kubernetes/website` repository, and someone on the SIG Docs team provides
editorial feedback or edits the draft directly.

### Find out about upcoming features

To find out about upcoming features, attend the weekly sig-release meeting (see
the [community](https://kubernetes.io/community/) page for upcoming meetings)
and monitor the release-specific documentation
in the [kubernetes/sig-release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/)
repository. Each release has a sub-directory under the [/sig-release/tree/master/releases/](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases)
directory. Each sub-directory contains a release schedule, a draft of the release
notes, and a document listing each person on the release team.

- The release schedule contains links to all other documents, meetings,
  meeting minutes, and milestones relating to the release. It also contains
  information about the goals and timeline of the release, and any special
  processes in place for this release. Near the bottom of the document, several
  release-related terms are defined.

    This document also contains a link to the **Feature tracking sheet**, which is
    the official way to find out about all new features scheduled to go into the
    release.
- The release team document lists who is responsible for each release role. If
  it's not clear who to talk to about a specific feature or question you have,
  either attend the release meeting to ask your question, or contact the release
  lead so that they can redirect you.
- The release notes draft is a good place to find out a little more about
  specific features, changes, deprecations, and more about the release. The
  content is not finalized until late in the release cycle, so use caution.

#### The feature tracking sheet

The feature tracking sheet
[for a given Kubernetes release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases) lists each feature that is planned for a release.
Each line item includes the name of the feature, a link to the feature's main
GitHub issue, its stability level (Alpha, Beta, or Stable), the SIG and
individual responsible for implementing it, whether it
needs docs, a draft release note for the feature, and whether it has been
merged. Keep the following in mind:

- Beta and Stable features are generally a higher documentation priority than
  Alpha features.
- It's hard to test (and therefore, document) a feature that hasn't been merged,
  or is at least considered feature-complete in its PR.
- Determining whether a feature needs documentation is a manual process and
  just because a feature is not marked as needing docs doesn't mean it doesn't
  need them.

### Document a feature

As stated above, draft content for new features is usually submitted by the SIG
responsible for implementing the new feature. This means that your role may be
more of a shepherding role for a given feature than developing the documentation
from scratch.

After you've chosen a feature to document/shepherd, ask about it in the `#sig-docs`
Slack channel, in a weekly sig-docs meeting, or directly on the PR filed by the
feature SIG. If you're given the go-ahead, you can edit into the PR using one of
the techniques described in
[Commit into another person's PR](#commit-into-another-persons-pr).

If you need to write a new topic, the following links are useful:

- [Writing a New Topic](/docs/contribute/style/write-new-topic/)
- [Using Page Templates](/docs/contribute/style/page-templates/)
- [Documentation Style Guide](/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/)
- [Documentation Content Guide](/docs/contribute/style/content-guide/)

### SIG members documenting new features

If you are a member of a SIG developing a new feature for Kubernetes, you need
to work with SIG Docs to be sure your feature is documented in time for the
release. Check the
[feature tracking spreadsheet](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases)
or check in the #sig-release Slack channel to verify scheduling details and
deadlines. Some deadlines related to documentation are:

- **Docs deadline - Open placeholder PRs**: Open a pull request against the
  `release-X.Y` branch in the `kubernetes/website` repository, with a small
  commit that you will amend later. Use the Prow command `/milestone X.Y` to
  assign the PR to the relevant milestone. This alerts the docs person managing
  this release that the feature docs are coming. If your feature does not need
  any documentation changes, make sure the sig-release team knows this, by
  mentioning it in the #sig-release Slack channel. If the feature does need
  documentation but the PR is not created, the feature may be removed from the
  milestone.
- **Docs deadline - PRs ready for review**: Your PR now needs to contain a first
  draft of the documentation for your feature. Don't worry about formatting or
  polishing. Just describe what the feature does and how to use it. The docs
  person managing the release will work with you to get the content into shape
  to be published. If your feature needs documentation and the first draft
  content is not received, the feature may be removed from the milestone.
- **Docs complete - All PRs reviewed and ready to merge**: If your PR has not
  yet been merged into the `release-X.Y` branch by this deadline, work with the
  docs person managing the release to get it in. If your feature needs
  documentation and the docs are not ready, the feature may be removed from the
  milestone.

If your feature is an Alpha feature and is behind a feature gate, make sure you
add it to [Feature gates](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
as part of your pull request. If your feature is moving out of Alpha, make sure to
remove it from that file.

## Contribute to other repos

The [Kubernetes project](https://github.com/kubernetes) contains more than 50
individual repositories. Many of these repositories contain code or content that
can be considered documentation, such as user-facing help text, error messages,
user-facing text in API references, or even code comments.

If you see text and you aren't sure where it comes from, you can use GitHub's
search tool at the level of the Kubernetes organization to search through all
repositories for that text. This can help you figure out where to submit your
issue or PR.

Each repository may have its own processes and procedures. Before you file an
issue or submit a PR, read that repository's `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and
`code-of-conduct.md`, if they exist.

Most repositories use issue and PR templates. Have a look through some open
issues and PRs to get a feel for that team's processes. Make sure to fill out
the templates with as much detail as possible when you file issues or PRs.

## Localize content

The Kubernetes documentation is written in English first, but we want people to
be able to read it in their language of choice. If you are comfortable
writing in another language, especially in the software domain, you can help
localize the Kubernetes documentation or provide feedback on existing localized
content. See [Localization](/docs/contribute/localization/) and ask on the
[kubernetes-sig-docs mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs)
or in `#sig-docs` on Slack if you are interested in helping out.

### Working with localized content

Follow these guidelines for working with localized content:

- Limit PRs to a single language.

   Each language has its own reviewers and approvers.

- Reviewers, verify that PRs contain changes to only one language.

   If a PR contains changes to source in more than one language, ask the PR contributor to open separate PRs for each language.
