This dashboard is built using Google Data Studio and shows information collected on kubernetes.io using Google Analytics.

### Using the dashboard

By default, the dashboard shows all collected analytics for the past 30 days. Use the date selector to see data from a different date range. Other filtering options allow you to view data based on user location, the device used to access the site, the translation of the docs used, and more.

 If you notice an issue with this dashboard, or would like to request any improvements, please [open an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/new/choose).
