<!-- overview -->

This tutorial shows you how to run a sample app
on Kubernetes using minikube and Katacoda.
Katacoda provides a free, in-browser Kubernetes environment.

{{< note >}}
You can also follow this tutorial if you've installed minikube locally.
See [minikube start](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) for installation instructions.
{{< /note >}}

## {{% heading "objectives" %}}

* Deploy a sample application to minikube.
* Run the app.
* View application logs.

This tutorial provides a container image that uses NGINX to echo back all the requests.

## Create a minikube cluster

1. Click **Launch Terminal**

    {{< kat-button >}}

{{< note >}}
If you installed minikube locally, run `minikube start`. Before you run `minikube dashboard`, you should open a new terminal, start `minikube dashboard` there, and then switch back to the main terminal.
{{< /note >}}

2. Open the Kubernetes dashboard in a browser:

    ```shell
    minikube dashboard
    ```

3. Katacoda environment only: At the top of the terminal pane, click the plus sign, and then click **Select port to view on Host 1**.

4. Katacoda environment only: Type `30000`, and then click **Display Port**.

{{< note >}}
The `dashboard` command enables the dashboard add-on and opens the proxy in the default web browser. You can create Kubernetes resources on the dashboard such as Deployment and Service.

If you are running in an environment as root, see [Open Dashboard with URL](/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube#open-dashboard-with-url).

To stop the proxy, run `Ctrl+C` to exit the process. The dashboard remains running.
{{< /note >}}

## Open Dashboard with URL

If you don't want to open a web browser, run the dashboard command with the url flag to emit a URL:

```shell
minikube dashboard --url
```

## Create a Deployment

A Kubernetes [*Pod*](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) is a group of one or more Containers,
tied together for the purposes of administration and networking. The Pod in this
tutorial has only one Container. A Kubernetes
[*Deployment*](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) checks on the health of your
Pod and restarts the Pod's Container if it terminates. Deployments are the
recommended way to manage the creation and scaling of Pods.

1. Use the `kubectl create` command to create a Deployment that manages a Pod. The
Pod runs a Container based on the provided Docker image.

    ```shell
    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
    ```

2. View the Deployment:

    ```shell
    kubectl get deployments
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    NAME         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    hello-node   1/1     1            1           1m
    ```

3. View the Pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    NAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    hello-node-5f76cf6ccf-br9b5   1/1       Running   0          1m
    ```

4. View cluster events:

    ```shell
    kubectl get events
    ```

5. View the `kubectl` configuration:

    ```shell
    kubectl config view
    ```

{{< note >}}
For more information about `kubectl` commands, see the [kubectl overview](/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).
{{< /note >}}

## Create a Service

By default, the Pod is only accessible by its internal IP address within the
Kubernetes cluster. To make the `hello-node` Container accessible from outside the
Kubernetes virtual network, you have to expose the Pod as a
Kubernetes [*Service*](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

1. Expose the Pod to the public internet using the `kubectl expose` command:

    ```shell
    kubectl expose deployment hello-node --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080
    ```

    The `--type=LoadBalancer` flag indicates that you want to expose your Service
    outside of the cluster.
    
    The application code inside the image `k8s.gcr.io/echoserver` only listens on TCP port 8080. If you used
    `kubectl expose` to expose a different port, clients could not connect to that other port.

2. View the Service you created:

    ```shell
    kubectl get services
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    hello-node   LoadBalancer   10.108.144.78   <pending>     8080:30369/TCP   21s
    kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          23m
    ```

    On cloud providers that support load balancers,
    an external IP address would be provisioned to access the Service. On minikube,
    the `LoadBalancer` type makes the Service accessible through the `minikube service`
    command.

3. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    minikube service hello-node
    ```

4. Katacoda environment only: Click the plus sign, and then click **Select port to view on Host 1**.

5. Katacoda environment only: Note the 5 digit port number displayed opposite to `8080` in services output. This port number is randomly generated and it can be different for you. Type your number in the port number text box, then click Display Port. Using the example from earlier, you would type `30369`.

    This opens up a browser window that serves your app and shows the app's response.

## Enable addons

The minikube tool includes a set of built-in {{< glossary_tooltip text="addons" term_id="addons" >}} that can be enabled, disabled and opened in the local Kubernetes environment.

1. List the currently supported addons:

    ```shell
    minikube addons list
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    addon-manager: enabled
    dashboard: enabled
    default-storageclass: enabled
    efk: disabled
    freshpod: disabled
    gvisor: disabled
    helm-tiller: disabled
    ingress: disabled
    ingress-dns: disabled
    logviewer: disabled
    metrics-server: disabled
    nvidia-driver-installer: disabled
    nvidia-gpu-device-plugin: disabled
    registry: disabled
    registry-creds: disabled
    storage-provisioner: enabled
    storage-provisioner-gluster: disabled
    ```

2. Enable an addon, for example, `metrics-server`:

    ```shell
    minikube addons enable metrics-server
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    metrics-server was successfully enabled
    ```

3. View the Pod and Service you created:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod,svc -n kube-system
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    NAME                                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/coredns-5644d7b6d9-mh9ll                1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/coredns-5644d7b6d9-pqd2t                1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/metrics-server-67fb648c5                1/1       Running   0          26s
    pod/etcd-minikube                           1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/influxdb-grafana-b29w8                  2/2       Running   0          26s
    pod/kube-addon-manager-minikube             1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/kube-apiserver-minikube                 1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/kube-controller-manager-minikube        1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/kube-proxy-rnlps                        1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/kube-scheduler-minikube                 1/1       Running   0          34m
    pod/storage-provisioner                     1/1       Running   0          34m

    NAME                           TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
    service/metrics-server         ClusterIP   10.96.241.45    <none>        80/TCP              26s
    service/kube-dns               ClusterIP   10.96.0.10      <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP       34m
    service/monitoring-grafana     NodePort    10.99.24.54     <none>        80:30002/TCP        26s
    service/monitoring-influxdb    ClusterIP   10.111.169.94   <none>        8083/TCP,8086/TCP   26s
    ```

4. Disable `metrics-server`:

    ```shell
    minikube addons disable metrics-server
    ```

    The output is similar to:

    ```
    metrics-server was successfully disabled
    ```

## Clean up

Now you can clean up the resources you created in your cluster:

```shell
kubectl delete service hello-node
kubectl delete deployment hello-node
```

Optionally, stop the Minikube virtual machine (VM):

```shell
minikube stop
```

Optionally, delete the Minikube VM:

```shell
minikube delete
```
