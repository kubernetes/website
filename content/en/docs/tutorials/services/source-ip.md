{{% capture overview %}}

Applications running in a Kubernetes cluster find and communicate with each
other, and the outside world, through the Service abstraction. This document
explains what happens to the source IP of packets sent to different types
of Services, and how you can toggle this behavior according to your needs.

### Prerequisites

{{< include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" >}}

The examples use a small nginx webserver that echoes back the source
IP of requests it receives through an HTTP header. You can create it as follows:

```shell
kubectl create deployment source-ip-app --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4
```
The output is:
```
deployment.apps/source-ip-app created
```

## Source IP for Services with `Type=ClusterIP`

Packets sent to ClusterIP from within the cluster are never source NAT'd if
you're running kube-proxy in
[iptables mode](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#proxy-mode-iptables),
(the default). You can query the kube-proxy mode by fetching
`http://localhost:10249/proxyMode` on the node where kube-proxy is running.

```console
kubectl get nodes
```
The output is similar to this:
```
NAME                           STATUS     ROLES    AGE     VERSION
kubernetes-node-6jst   Ready      <none>   2h      v1.13.0
kubernetes-node-cx31   Ready      <none>   2h      v1.13.0
kubernetes-node-jj1t   Ready      <none>   2h      v1.13.0
```

Get the proxy mode on one of the nodes (kube-proxy listens on port 10249):
```shell
# Run this in a shell on the node you want to query.
curl http://localhost:10249/proxyMode
```
The output is:
```
iptables
```

You can test source IP preservation by creating a Service over the source IP app:

```shell
kubectl expose deployment source-ip-app --name=clusterip --port=80 --target-port=8080
```
The output is:
```
service/clusterip exposed
```
```shell
kubectl get svc clusterip
```
The output is similar to:
```
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
clusterip    ClusterIP   10.0.170.92   <none>        80/TCP    51s
```

And hitting the `ClusterIP` from a pod in the same cluster:

```shell
kubectl run busybox -it --image=busybox --restart=Never --rm
```
The output is similar to this:
```
Waiting for pod default/busybox to be running, status is Pending, pod ready: false
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

```
You can then run a command inside that Pod:

```shell
# Run this inside the terminal from "kubectl run"
ip addr
```
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 ::1/128 scope host
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1460 qdisc noqueue
    link/ether 0a:58:0a:f4:03:08 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.244.3.8/24 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::188a:84ff:feb0:26a5/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

â€¦then use `wget` to query the local webserver
```shell
# Replace 10.0.170.92 with the Pod's IPv4 address
wget -qO - 10.0.170.92
```
```
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=10.244.3.8
command=GET
...
```
The `client_address` is always the client pod's IP address, whether the client pod and server pod are in the same node or in different nodes.

## Source IP for Services with `Type=NodePort`

Packets sent to Services with
[`Type=NodePort`](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport)
are source NAT'd by default. You can test this by creating a `NodePort` Service:

```shell
kubectl expose deployment source-ip-app --name=nodeport --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=NodePort
```
The output is:
```
service/nodeport exposed
```

```shell
NODEPORT=$(kubectl get -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services nodeport)
NODES=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{ $.items[*].status.addresses[?(@.type=="ExternalIP")].address }')
```

If you're running on a cloud provider, you may need to open up a firewall-rule
for the `nodes:nodeport` reported above.
Now you can try reaching the Service from outside the cluster through the node
port allocated above.

```shell
for node in $NODES; do curl -s $node:$NODEPORT | grep -i client_address; done
```
The output is similar to:
```
client_address=10.180.1.1
client_address=10.240.0.5
client_address=10.240.0.3
```

Note that these are not the correct client IPs, they're cluster internal IPs. This is what happens:

* Client sends packet to `node2:nodePort`
* `node2` replaces the source IP address (SNAT) in the packet with its own IP address
* `node2` replaces the destination IP on the packet with the pod IP
* packet is routed to node 1, and then to the endpoint
* the pod's reply is routed back to node2
* the pod's reply is sent back to the client

Visually:

```
          client
             \ ^
              \ \
               v \
   node 1 <--- node 2
    | ^   SNAT
    | |   --->
    v |
 endpoint
```


To avoid this, Kubernetes has a feature to
[preserve the client source IP](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip).
If you set `service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` to the value `Local`,
kube-proxy only proxies proxy requests to local endpoints, and does not
forward traffic to other nodes. This approach preserves the original
source IP address. If there are no local endpoints, packets sent to the
node are dropped, so you can rely on the correct source-ip in any packet
processing rules you might apply a packet that make it through to the
endpoint.

Set the `service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy` field as follows:

```shell
kubectl patch svc nodeport -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'
```
The output is:
```
service/nodeport patched
```

Now, re-run the test:

```shell
for node in $NODES; do curl --connect-timeout 1 -s $node:$NODEPORT | grep -i client_address; done
```
The output is similar to:
```
client_address=198.51.100.79
```

Note that you only got one reply, with the *right* client IP, from the one node on which the endpoint pod
is running.

This is what happens:

* client sends packet to `node2:nodePort`, which doesn't have any endpoints
* packet is dropped
* client sends packet to `node1:nodePort`, which *does* have endpoints
* node1 routes packet to endpoint with the correct source IP

Visually:

```
        client
       ^ /   \
      / /     \
     / v       X
   node 1     node 2
    ^ |
    | |
    | v
 endpoint
```



## Source IP for Services with `Type=LoadBalancer`

Packets sent to Services with
[`Type=LoadBalancer`](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer)
are source NAT'd by default, because all schedulable Kubernetes nodes in the
`Ready` state are eligible for load-balanced traffic. So if packets arrive
at a node without an endpoint, the system proxies it to a node *with* an
endpoint, replacing the source IP on the packet with the IP of the node (as
described in the previous section).

You can test this by exposing the source-ip-app through a load balancer:

```shell
kubectl expose deployment source-ip-app --name=loadbalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080 --type=LoadBalancer
```
The output is:
```
service/loadbalancer exposed
```

Print out the IP addresses of the Service:
```console
kubectl get svc loadbalancer
```
The output is similar to this:
```
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP       PORT(S)   AGE
loadbalancer   LoadBalancer   10.0.65.118   203.0.113.140     80/TCP    5m
```

Next, send a request to this Service's external-ip:

```shell
curl 203.0.113.140
```
The output is similar to this:
```
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=10.240.0.5
...
```

However, if you're running on Google Kubernetes Engine/GCE, setting the same `service.spec.externalTrafficPolicy`
field to `Local` forces nodes *without* Service endpoints to remove
themselves from the list of nodes eligible for loadbalanced traffic by
deliberately failing health checks.

Visually:

```
                      client
                        |
                      lb VIP
                     / ^
                    v /
health check --->   node 1   node 2 <--- health check
        200  <---   ^ |             ---> 500
                    | V
                 endpoint
```

You can test this by setting the annotation:

```shell
kubectl patch svc loadbalancer -p '{"spec":{"externalTrafficPolicy":"Local"}}'
```

You should immediately see the `service.spec.healthCheckNodePort` field allocated
by Kubernetes:

```shell
kubectl get svc loadbalancer -o yaml | grep -i healthCheckNodePort
```
The output is similar to this:
```yaml
  healthCheckNodePort: 32122
```

The `service.spec.healthCheckNodePort` field points to a port on every node
serving the health check at `/healthz`. You can test this:

```shell
kubectl get pod -o wide -l run=source-ip-app
```
The output is similar to this:
```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP             NODE
source-ip-app-826191075-qehz4   1/1       Running   0          20h       10.180.1.136   kubernetes-node-6jst
```

Use `curl` to fetch the `/healthz` endpoint on various nodes:
```shell
# Run this locally on a node you choose
curl localhost:32122/healthz
```
```
1 Service Endpoints found
```

On a different node you might get a different result:
```shell
# Run this locally on a node you choose
curl localhost:32122/healthz
```
```
No Service Endpoints Found
```

A controller running on the
{{< glossary_tooltip text="control plane" term_id="control-plane" >}} is
responsible for allocating the cloud load balancer. The same controller also
allocates HTTP health checks pointing to this port/path on each node. Wait
about 10 seconds for the 2 nodes without endpoints to fail health checks,
then use `curl` to query the IPv4 address of the load balancer:

```shell
curl 203.0.113.140
```
The output is similar to this:
```
CLIENT VALUES:
client_address=198.51.100.79
...
```

## Cross-platform support

Only some cloud providers offer support for source IP preservation through
Services with `Type=LoadBalancer`.
The cloud provider you're running on might fulfill the request for a loadbalancer
in a few different ways:

1. With a proxy that terminates the client connection and opens a new connection
to your nodes/endpoints. In such cases the source IP will always be that of the
cloud LB, not that of the client.

2. With a packet forwarder, such that requests from the client sent to the
loadbalancer VIP end up at the node with the source IP of the client, not
an intermediate proxy.

Load balancers in the first category must use an agreed upon
protocol between the loadbalancer and backend to communicate the true client IP
such as the HTTP [Forwarded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239#section-5.2)
or [X-FORWARDED-FOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For)
headers, or the
[proxy protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt).
Load balancers in the second category can leverage the feature described above
by creating an HTTP health check pointing at the port stored in
the `service.spec.healthCheckNodePort` field on the Service.
