<!-- FUTURE MAINTAINERS: 
The original point of this doc was for people (mainly cluster administrators) to
understand the importance of the DRA driver and its interaction with the DRA
APIs. As a result it was a requirement of this tutorial to not use Helm and to
be more direct with all the component installation procedures. While much of
this content is also useful to workload authors, I see the primary audience of
_this_ tutorial as cluster administrators, who I feel also need to understand
how the DRA APIs interact with the driver to maintain them well. If I had to
choose which audience to focus on in this doc, I would choose cluster
administrators. If the prose gets too muddied by considering both of them, I'd
rather make a second tutorial for the workload authors that doesn't go into the
driver at all (since IMHO that is more representative of what we think their
experience should be like) and also potentially goes into much more detailed/ ✨
fun ✨ use cases.

<!-- overview -->
This tutorial shows you how to install {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="dra"
text="Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)" >}} drivers in your cluster and how to
use them in conjunction with the DRA APIs to allocate {{< glossary_tooltip
text="devices" term_id="device"
>}} to Pods. This page is intended for cluster administrators.

{{< glossary_tooltip text="Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)" term_id="dra" >}}
lets a cluster manage availability and allocation of hardware resources to
satisfy Pod-based claims for hardware requirements and preferences. To support
this, a mixture of Kubernetes built-in components (like the Kubernetes
scheduler, kubelet, and kube-controller-manager) and third-party drivers from
device owners (called DRA drivers) share the responsibility to advertise,
allocate, prepare, mount, healthcheck, unprepare, and cleanup resources
throughout the Pod lifecycle. These components share information via a series of
DRA specific APIs in the `resource.k8s.io` API group including {{<
glossary_tooltip text="DeviceClasses" term_id="deviceclass" >}}, {{<
glossary_tooltip text="ResourceSlices" term_id="resourceslice" >}}, {{<
glossary_tooltip text="ResourceClaims" term_id="resourceclaim" >}}, as well as
new fields in the Pod spec itself.

<!-- objectives -->

### {{% heading "objectives" %}}
* Deploy an example DRA driver
* Deploy a Pod requesting a hardware claim using DRA APIs
* Delete a Pod that has a claim

<!-- prerequisites -->
## {{% heading "prerequisites" %}}

Your cluster should support [RBAC](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/).
You can try this tutorial with a cluster using
a different authorization mechanism, but in that case you will have to adapt the
steps around defining roles and permissions.

{{< include "task-tutorial-prereqs.md" >}}

This tutorial has been tested with Linux nodes, though it may also work with
other types of nodes.

 {{< version-check >}}

Your cluster also must be configured to use the Dynamic Resource Allocation
feature.
To enable the DRA feature, you must enable the following feature gates and API groups:

1.  Enable the `DynamicResourceAllocation`
    [feature gate](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
    on all of the following components:
   
    * `kube-apiserver`
    * `kube-controller-manager`
    * `kube-scheduler`
    * `kubelet`

1.  Enable the following
    {{< glossary_tooltip text="API groups" term_id="api-group" >}}:

    * `resource.k8s.io/v1beta1`
    * `resource.k8s.io/v1beta2`
     
    For more information, see
    [Enabling or disabling API groups](/docs/reference/using-api/#enabling-or-disabling).

## Explore the initial cluster state {#explore-initial-state}

You can spend some time to observe the initial state of a cluster with DRA
enabled, especially if you have not used these APIs extensively before. If you
set up a new cluster for this tutorial, with no driver installed and no Pod
claims yet to satisfy, the output of these commands won't show any resources.

1.  Get a list of {{< glossary_tooltip text="DeviceClasses" term_id="deviceclass" >}}:

    ```shell
    kubectl get deviceclasses
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    No resources found
    ```

1.  Get a list of  {{< glossary_tooltip text="ResourceSlices" term_id="resourceslice" >}}:

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceslices
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    No resources found
    ```

1.  Get a list of {{< glossary_tooltip text="ResourceClaims" term_id="resourceclaim" >}} and {{<
glossary_tooltip text="ResourceClaimTemplates" term_id="resourceclaimtemplate"
>}}

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceclaims -A
    kubectl get resourceclaimtemplates -A
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    No resources found
    No resources found
    ```

At this point, you have confirmed that DRA is enabled and configured properly in
the cluster, and that no DRA drivers have advertised any resources to the DRA
APIs yet.

## Install an example DRA driver {#install-example-driver}  

DRA drivers are third-party applications that run on each node of your cluster
to interface with the hardware of that node and Kubernetes' built-in DRA
components. The installation procedure depends on the driver you choose, but is
likely deployed as a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="daemonset" >}} to all or a
selection of the nodes (using {{< glossary_tooltip text="selectors"
term_id="selector" >}} or similar mechanisms) in your cluster.

Check your driver's documentation for specific installation instructions, which
might include a Helm chart, a set of manifests, or other deployment tooling.

This tutorial uses an example driver which can be found in the
[kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver)
repository to demonstrate driver installation. This example driver advertises
simulated GPUs to Kubernetes for your Pods to interact with.

### Prepare your cluster for driver installation {#prepare-cluster-driver}

To simplify cleanup, create a namespace named dra-tutorial:

1.  Create the namespace:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace dra-tutorial 
    ```

In a production environment, you would likely be using a previously released or
qualified image from the driver vendor or your own organization, and your nodes
would need to have access to the image registry where the driver image is
hosted. In this tutorial, you will use a publicly released image of the
dra-example-driver to simulate access to a DRA driver image.


1.  Confirm your nodes have access to the image by running the following
from within one of your cluster's nodes:

    ```shell
    docker pull registry.k8s.io/dra-example-driver/dra-example-driver:v0.1.0
    ```

### Deploy the DRA driver components

For this tutorial, you will install the critical example resource driver
components individually with `kubectl`.

1.  Create the DeviceClass representing the device types this DRA driver
   supports:

    {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/deviceclass.yaml" %}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/deviceclass.yaml
    ```

1.  Create the ServiceAccount, ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding that will
be used by the driver to gain permissions to interact with the Kubernetes API
on this cluster:

      1.  Create the Service Account: 

          {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/serviceaccount.yaml" %}}

          ```shell
          kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/serviceaccount.yaml
          ```

      1.  Create the ClusterRole: 

          {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/clusterrole.yaml" %}}

          ```shell
          kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/clusterrole.yaml
          ```

      1.  Create the ClusterRoleBinding:

          {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/clusterrolebinding.yaml" %}}

          ```shell
          kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/clusterrolebinding.yaml
          ```

1.  Create a {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="priority-class" >}} for the DRA
    driver. The PriorityClass prevents preemption of th  DRA driver component,
    which is responsible for important lifecycle operations for Pods with
    claims. Learn more about [pod priority and preemption
    here](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/).

    {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/priorityclass.yaml" %}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/priorityclass.yaml
    ```

1.  Deploy the actual DRA driver as a DaemonSet configured to run the example
   driver binary with the permissions provisioned above. The DaemonSet has the
   permissions that you granted to the ServiceAccount in the previous steps.

    {{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/daemonset.yaml" %}}

    ```shell
    kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/daemonset.yaml
    ```
    The DaemonSet is configured with
      the volume mounts necessary to interact with the underlying Container Device
      Interface (CDI) directory, and to expose its socket to `kubelet` via the
      `kubelet/plugins` directory.

### Verify the DRA driver installation {#verify-driver-install}

1.  Get a list of the Pods of the DRA driver DaemonSet across all worker nodes:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -l app.kubernetes.io/name=dra-example-driver -n dra-tutorial
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    dra-example-driver-kubeletplugin-4sk2x   1/1     Running   0          13s
    dra-example-driver-kubeletplugin-cttr2   1/1     Running   0          13s
    ```


1.  The initial reponsibility of each node's local DRA driver is to update the
cluster with what devices are available to Pods on that node, by publishing its
metadata to the ResourceSlices API. You can check that API to see that each node
with a driver is advertising the device class it represents. 

    Check for available ResourceSlices: 

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceslices
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    NAME                                 NODE           DRIVER            POOL           AGE
    kind-worker-gpu.example.com-k69gd    kind-worker    gpu.example.com   kind-worker    19s
    kind-worker2-gpu.example.com-qdgpn   kind-worker2   gpu.example.com   kind-worker2   19s
    ```

At this point, you have successfully installed the example DRA driver, and
confirmed its initial configuration. You're now ready to use DRA to schedule
Pods.

## Claim resources and deploy a Pod {#claim-resources-pod}

To request resources using DRA, you create ResourceClaims or
ResourceClaimTemplates that define the resources that your Pods need. In the
example driver, a memory capacity attribute is exposed for mock GPU devices.
This section shows you how to use {{< glossary_tooltip term_id="cel" >}} to
express your requirements in a ResourceClaim, select that ResourceClaim in a Pod
specification, and observe the resource allocation.

This tutorial showcases only one basic example of a DRA ResourceClaim. Read
[Dynamic Resource
Allocation](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/dynamic-resource-allocation/) to
learn more about ResourceClaims. 

### Create the ResourceClaim

In this section, you create a ResourceClaim and reference it in a Pod. Whatever
the claim, the `deviceClassName` is a required field, narrowing down the scope
of the request to a specific device class. The request itself can include a {{<
glossary_tooltip term_id="cel" >}} expression that references attributes that
may be advertised by the driver managing that device class. 

In this example, you will create a request for any GPU advertising over 10Gi
memory capacity. The attribute exposing capacity from the example driver takes
the form `device.capacity['gpu.example.com'].memory`. Note also that the name of
the claim is set to `some-gpu`.

{{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/example/resourceclaim.yaml" %}}

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/example/resourceclaim.yaml
```

### Create the Pod that references that ResourceClaim

Below is the Pod manifest referencing the ResourceClaim you just made,
`some-gpu`, in the `spec.resourceClaims.resourceClaimName` field. The local name
for that claim, `gpu`, is then used in the
`spec.containers.resources.claims.name` field to allocate the claim to the Pod's
underlying container.

{{% code_sample language="yaml" file="dra/driver-install/example/pod.yaml" %}}

```shell
kubectl apply --server-side -f http://k8s.io/examples/dra/driver-install/example/pod.yaml
```

1.  Confirm the pod has deployed:

    ```shell
    kubectl get pod pod0 -n dra-tutorial
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod0   1/1     Running   0          9s
    ```

### Explore the DRA state

After you create the Pod, the cluster tries to schedule that Pod to a node where
Kubernetes can satisfy the ResourceClaim. In this tutorial, the DRA driver is
deployed on all nodes, and is advertising mock GPUs on all nodes, all of which
have enough capacity advertised to satisfy the Pod's claim, so Kubernetes can
schedule this Pod on any node and can allocate any of the mock GPUs on that
node.

When Kubernetes allocates a mock GPU to a Pod, the example driver adds
environment variables in each container it is allocated to in order to indicate
which GPUs _would_ have been injected into them by a real resource driver and
how they would have been configured, so you can check those environment
variables to see how the Pods have been handled by the system.

1.  Check the Pod logs, which report the name of the mock GPU that was allocated:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs pod0 -c ctr0 -n dra-tutorial | grep -E "GPU_DEVICE_[0-9]+=" | grep -v "RESOURCE_CLAIM"
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    declare -x GPU_DEVICE_4="gpu-4"
    ```

1.  Check the state of the ResourceClaim object:

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceclaims -n dra-tutorial
    ```

    The output is similar to this:

    ```
    NAME       STATE                AGE
    some-gpu   allocated,reserved   34s
    ```

    In this output, the `STATE` column shows that the ResourceClaim is allocated
    and reserved.

1.  Check the details of the `some-gpu` ResourceClaim. The `status` stanza of
    the ResourceClaim has information about the allocated device and the Pod it
    has been reserved for:

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceclaim some-gpu -n dra-tutorial -o yaml
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    {{< highlight yaml "linenos=inline, hl_lines=30-33 41-44, style=emacs" >}}

    kind: List
    metadata:
      resourceVersion: ""
    {{< /highlight >}}

1.  To check how the driver handled device allocation, get the logs for the
    driver DaemonSet Pods:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=dra-example-driver -n dra-tutorial
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    I0729 05:11:52.679057       1 driver.go:84] NodePrepareResource is called: number of claims: 1
    I0729 05:11:52.684450       1 driver.go:112] Returning newly prepared devices for claim '79e1e8d8-7e53-4362-aad1-eca97678339e': [&Device{RequestNames:[some-gpu],PoolName:kind-worker,DeviceName:gpu-4,CDIDeviceIDs:[k8s.gpu.example.com/gpu=common k8s.gpu.example.com/gpu=79e1e8d8-7e53-4362-aad1-eca97678339e-gpu-4],}]
    ```

You have now successfully deployed a Pod that claims devices using DRA, verified
that the Pod was scheduled to an appropriate node, and saw that the associated
DRA APIs kinds were updated with the allocation status.

## Delete a Pod that has a claim {#delete-pod-claim}

When a Pod with a claim is deleted, the DRA driver deallocates the resource so
it can be available for future scheduling. To validate this behavior, delete the
Pod that you created in the previous steps and watch the corresponding changes
to the ResourceClaim and driver.

1.  Delete the `pod0` Pod:

    ```shell
    kubectl delete pod pod0 -n dra-tutorial
    ```

    The output is similar to this:

    ```
    pod "pod0" deleted
    ```

### Observe the DRA state

When the Pod is deleted, the driver deallocates the device from the
ResourceClaim and updates the ResourceClaim resource in the Kubernetes API. The
ResourceClaim has a `pending` state until it's referenced in a new Pod.

1.  Check the state of the `some-gpu` ResourceClaim:

    ```shell
    kubectl get resourceclaims -n dra-tutorial
    ```

    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    NAME       STATE     AGE
    some-gpu   pending   76s
    ```

1.  Verify that the driver has processed unpreparing the device for this claim by
   checking the driver logs:

    ```shell
    kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=dra-example-driver -n dra-tutorial
    ```
    The output is similar to this:
    ```
    I0729 05:13:02.144623       1 driver.go:117] NodeUnPrepareResource is called: number of claims: 1
    ```

You have now deleted a Pod that had a claim, and observed that the driver took
action to unprepare the underlying hardware resource and update the DRA APIs to
reflect that the resource is available again for future scheduling.
