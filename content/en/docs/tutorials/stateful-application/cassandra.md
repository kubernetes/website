{{% capture overview %}}
This tutorial shows you how to develop a native cloud [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) deployment on Kubernetes. In this instance, a custom Cassandra `SeedProvider` enables Cassandra to discover new Cassandra nodes as they join the cluster.

Deploying stateful distributed applications, like Cassandra, within a clustered environment can be challenging. StatefulSets greatly simplify this process. Please read about [StatefulSets](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)  for more information about the features used in this tutorial.

**Cassandra Docker**

The Pods use the [`gcr.io/google-samples/cassandra:v13`](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/blob/master/cassandra/image/Dockerfile)
image from Google's [container registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/).
The docker image above is based on [debian-base](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/build/debian-base) and includes OpenJDK 8. This image includes a standard Cassandra installation from the Apache Debian repo.  By using environment variables you can change values that are inserted into `cassandra.yaml`.

| ENV VAR       | DEFAULT VALUE  |
| ------------- |:-------------: |
| CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME | 'Test Cluster'  |
| CASSANDRA_NUM_TOKENS  | 32               |
| CASSANDRA_RPC_ADDRESS | 0.0.0.0          |

{{% capture prerequisites %}}
To complete this tutorial, you should already have a basic familiarity with [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/), [Services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), and [StatefulSets](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/). In addition, you should:

* [Install and Configure](/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) the `kubectl` command line

* Download [cassandra-service.yaml](/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/cassandra/cassandra-service.yaml) and [cassandra-statefulset.yaml](/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/cassandra/cassandra-statefulset.yaml)

* Have a supported Kubernetes Cluster running

{{< note >}}
**Note:** Please read the [getting started guides](/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/) if you do not already have a cluster.

### Additional Minikube Setup Instructions

{{< caution >}}
**Caution:** [Minikube](/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) defaults to 1024MB of memory and 1 CPU which results in an insufficient resource errors during this tutorial. 
{{< /caution >}}

To avoid these errors, run minikube with:

    minikube start --memory 5120 --cpus=4

## Creating a Cassandra Headless Service
A Kubernetes [Service](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) describes a set of [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) that perform the same task. 

The following `Service` is used for DNS lookups between Cassandra Pods and clients within the Kubernetes Cluster.

1. Launch a terminal window in the directory you downloaded the manifest files.
2. Create a `Service` to track all Cassandra StatefulSet Nodes from the `cassandra-service.yaml` file:

       kubectl create -f cassandra-service.yaml

{{< code file="cassandra/cassandra-service.yaml" >}}

### Validating (optional)

Get the Cassandra `Service`.

    kubectl get svc cassandra

The response should be

    NAME        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
    cassandra   None         <none>        9042/TCP   45s

If anything else returns, the service was not successfully created. Read [Debug Services](/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-service/) for common issues.

## Using a StatefulSet to Create a Cassandra Ring

The StatefulSet manifest, included below, creates a Cassandra ring that consists of three Pods.

{{< note >}}
**Note:** This example uses the default provisioner for Minikube. Please update the following StatefulSet for the cloud you are working with.
{{< /note >}}

1. Update the StatefulSet if necessary.
2. Create the Cassandra StatefulSet from the `cassandra-statefulset.yaml` file:

       kubectl create -f cassandra-statefulset.yaml

{{< code file="cassandra/cassandra-statefulset.yaml" >}}

## Validating The Cassandra StatefulSet

1. Get the Cassandra StatefulSet:

       kubectl get statefulset cassandra

   The response should be

       NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
       cassandra   3         0         13s

   The StatefulSet resource deploys Pods sequentially.  

2. Get the Pods to see the ordered creation status:

       kubectl get pods -l="app=cassandra"
       
   The response should be    
       
       NAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
       cassandra-0   1/1       Running             0          1m
       cassandra-1   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          8s

   {{< note >}}
   **Note:** It can take up to ten minutes for all three Pods to deploy. 
   {{< /note >}}

    Once all Pods are deployed, the same command returns:

       NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
       cassandra-0   1/1       Running   0          10m
       cassandra-1   1/1       Running   0          9m
       cassandra-2   1/1       Running   0          8m

3. Run the Cassandra utility nodetool to display the status of the ring.

       kubectl exec cassandra-0 -- nodetool status

   The response is:

       Datacenter: DC1-K8Demo
       ======================

       |/ State=Normal/Leaving/Joining/Moving

## Modifying the Cassandra StatefulSet
Use `kubectl edit` to modify the size of a Cassandra StatefulSet. 

1. Run the following command:

       kubectl edit statefulset cassandra

   This command opens an editor in your terminal. The line you need to change is the `replicas` field.
   
   {{< note >}}
   **Note:** The following sample is an excerpt of the StatefulSet file.
   {{< /note >}}

        # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a '#' will be ignored,
        # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
        # reopened with the relevant failures.
        #
        apiVersion: apps/v1 # for versions before 1.9.0 use apps/v1beta2
        kind: StatefulSet
        metadata:
         creationTimestamp: 2016-08-13T18:40:58Z
         generation: 1
         labels:
           app: cassandra
         name: cassandra
         namespace: default
         resourceVersion: "323"
         selfLink: /apis/apps/v1/namespaces/default/statefulsets/cassandra
         uid: 7a219483-6185-11e6-a910-42010a8a0fc0
        spec:
         replicas: 3

2. Change the number of replicas to 4, and then save the manifest. 

   The StatefulSet now contains 4 Pods.

3. Get the Cassandra StatefulSet to verify:

       kubectl get statefulset cassandra

   The response should be

       NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
       cassandra   4         4         36m

{{% capture cleanup %}}
Deleting or scaling a StatefulSet down does not delete the volumes associated with the StatefulSet. This ensures safety first: your data is more valuable than an auto purge of all related StatefulSet resources. 

{{< warning >}}
**Warning:** Depending on the storage class and reclaim policy, deleting the Persistent Volume Claims may cause the associated volumes to also be deleted. Never assume youâ€™ll be able to access data if its volume claims are deleted.
{{< /warning >}}

1. Run the following commands to delete everything in a `StatefulSet`:

       grace=$(kubectl get po cassandra-0 -o=jsonpath='{.spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds}') \
         && kubectl delete statefulset -l app=cassandra \
         && echo "Sleeping $grace" \
         && sleep $grace \
         && kubectl delete pvc -l app=cassandra

2. Run the following command to delete the Cassandra `Service`.

       kubectl delete service -l app=cassandra
