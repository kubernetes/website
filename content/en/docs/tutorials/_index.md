<!-- overview -->

This section of the Kubernetes documentation contains tutorials.
A tutorial shows how to accomplish a goal that is larger than a single
[task](/docs/tasks/). Typically a tutorial has several sections,
each of which has a sequence of steps.
Before walking through each tutorial, you may want to bookmark the
[Standardized Glossary](/docs/reference/glossary/) page for later references.
