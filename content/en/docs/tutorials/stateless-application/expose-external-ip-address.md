{{% capture overview %}}

This page shows how to create a Kubernetes Service object that exposes an
external IP address.

{{% /capture %}}


{{% capture prerequisites %}}

 * Install [kubectl](/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

 * Use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine or Amazon Web Services to
 create a Kubernetes cluster. This tutorial creates an
 [external load balancer](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/),
 which requires a cloud provider.

 * Configure `kubectl` to communicate with your Kubernetes API server. For
 instructions, see the documentation for your cloud provider.

* Run five instances of a Hello World application.
* Create a Service object that exposes an external IP address.
* Use the Service object to access the running application.

## Creating a service for an application running in five pods

1. Run a Hello World application in your cluster:

       kubectl run hello-world --replicas=5 --labels="run=load-balancer-example" --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0  --port=8080

    The preceding command creates a
    [Deployment](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
    object and an associated
    [ReplicaSet](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
    object. The ReplicaSet has five
    [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/),
    each of which runs the Hello World application.

1. Display information about the Deployment:

       kubectl get deployments hello-world
       kubectl describe deployments hello-world

1. Display information about your ReplicaSet objects:

       kubectl get replicasets
       kubectl describe replicasets

1. Create a Service object that exposes the deployment:

       kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --name=my-service

1. Display information about the Service:

       kubectl get services my-service

    The output is similar to this:

        NAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)    AGE
        my-service   10.3.245.137   104.198.205.71   8080/TCP   54s

    Note: If the external IP address is shown as \<pending\>, wait for a minute
    and enter the same command again.

1. Display detailed information about the Service:

       kubectl describe services my-service

    The output is similar to this:

        Name:           my-service
        Namespace:      default
        Labels:         run=load-balancer-example
        Annotations:    <none>
        Selector:       run=load-balancer-example
        Type:           LoadBalancer
        IP:             10.3.245.137
        LoadBalancer Ingress:   104.198.205.71
        Port:           <unset> 8080/TCP
        NodePort:       <unset> 32377/TCP
        Endpoints:      10.0.0.6:8080,10.0.1.6:8080,10.0.1.7:8080 + 2 more...
        Session Affinity:   None
        Events:         <none>

    Make a note of the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) exposed by
    your service. In this example, the external IP address is 104.198.205.71.
    Also note the value of `Port` and `NodePort`. In this example, the `Port`
    is 8080 and the `NodePort` is 32377.

1. In the preceding output, you can see that the service has several endpoints:
   10.0.0.6:8080,10.0.1.6:8080,10.0.1.7:8080 + 2 more. These are internal
   addresses of the pods that are running the Hello World application. To
   verify these are pod addresses, enter this command:

       kubectl get pods --output=wide

    The output is similar to this:

        NAME                         ...  IP         NODE
        hello-world-2895499144-1jaz9 ...  10.0.1.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
        hello-world-2895499144-2e5uh ...  10.0.1.8   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
        hello-world-2895499144-9m4h1 ...  10.0.0.6   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-5v7a
        hello-world-2895499144-o4z13 ...  10.0.1.7   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-1afc
        hello-world-2895499144-segjf ...  10.0.2.5   gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e0b8d269-cpuc

1. Use the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`) to access the Hello
   World application:

       curl http://<external-ip>:<port>

    where `<external-ip>` is the external IP address (`LoadBalancer Ingress`)
    of your Service, and `<port>` is the value of `Port` in your Service
    description.
    If you are using minikube, typing `minikube service my-service` will
    automatically open the Hello World application in a browser.

    The response to a successful request is a hello message:

        Hello Kubernetes!

{{% capture cleanup %}}

To delete the Service, enter this command:

    kubectl delete services my-service

To delete the Deployment, the ReplicaSet, and the Pods that are running
the Hello World application, enter this command:

    kubectl delete deployment hello-world
