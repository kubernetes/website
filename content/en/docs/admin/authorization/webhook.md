title: Webhook Mode
content_template: templates/concept

{{% capture overview %}}
A WebHook is an HTTP callback: an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens; a simple event-notification via HTTP POST. A web application implementing WebHooks will POST a message to a URL when certain things happen.

When specified, mode `Webhook` causes Kubernetes to query an outside REST
service when determining user privileges.

## Configuration File Format

Mode `Webhook` requires a file for HTTP configuration, specify by the
`--authorization-webhook-config-file=SOME_FILENAME` flag.

The configuration file uses the [kubeconfig](/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/)
file format. Within the file "users" refers to the API Server webhook and
"clusters" refers to the remote service.

A configuration example which uses HTTPS client auth:

```yaml
# clusters refers to the remote service.
clusters:
  - name: name-of-remote-authz-service
    cluster:
      # CA for verifying the remote service.
      certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.pem
      # URL of remote service to query. Must use 'https'. May not include parameters.
      server: https://authz.example.com/authorize

# users refers to the API Server's webhook configuration.
users:
  - name: name-of-api-server
    user:
      client-certificate: /path/to/cert.pem # cert for the webhook plugin to use
      client-key: /path/to/key.pem          # key matching the cert

# kubeconfig files require a context. Provide one for the API Server.
current-context: webhook
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: name-of-remote-authz-service
    user: name-of-api-server
  name: webhook
```

## Request Payloads

When faced with an authorization decision, the API Server POSTs a JSON-
serialized `authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` `SubjectAccessReview` object describing the
action. This object contains fields describing the user attempting to make the
request, and either details about the resource being accessed or requests
attributes.

Note that webhook API objects are subject to the same [versioning compatibility rules](/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/)
as other Kubernetes API objects. Implementers should be aware of looser
compatibility promises for beta objects and check the "apiVersion" field of the
request to ensure correct deserialization. Additionally, the API Server must
enable the `authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1` API extensions group (`--runtime-config=authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1=true`).

An example request body:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "kind": "SubjectAccessReview",
  "spec": {
    "resourceAttributes": {
      "namespace": "kittensandponies",
      "verb": "get",
      "group": "unicorn.example.org",
      "resource": "pods"
    },
    "user": "jane",
    "group": [
      "group1",
      "group2"
    ]
  }
}
```

The remote service is expected to fill the `status` field of
the request and respond to either allow or disallow access. The response body's
`spec` field is ignored and may be omitted. A permissive response would return:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "kind": "SubjectAccessReview",
  "status": {
    "allowed": true
  }
}
```

To disallow access, the remote service would return:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "kind": "SubjectAccessReview",
  "status": {
    "allowed": false,
    "reason": "user does not have read access to the namespace"
  }
}
```

Access to non-resource paths are sent as:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1",
  "kind": "SubjectAccessReview",
  "spec": {
    "nonResourceAttributes": {
      "path": "/debug",
      "verb": "get"
    },
    "user": "jane",
    "group": [
      "group1",
      "group2"
    ]
  }
}
```

Non-resource paths include: `/api`, `/apis`, `/metrics`, `/resetMetrics`,
`/logs`, `/debug`, `/healthz`, `/swagger-ui/`, `/swaggerapi/`, `/ui`, and
`/version.` Clients require access to `/api`, `/api/*`, `/apis`, `/apis/*`,
and `/version` to discover what resources and versions are present on the server.
Access to other non-resource paths can be disallowed without restricting access
to the REST api.
