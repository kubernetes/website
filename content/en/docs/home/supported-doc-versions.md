This website contains documentation for the current version of Kubernetes
and the four previous versions of Kubernetes.

The availability of documentation for a Kubernetes version is separate from whether
that release is currently supported.
Read [Support period](/releases/patch-releases/#support-period) to learn about
which versions of Kubernetes are officially supported, and for how long.
