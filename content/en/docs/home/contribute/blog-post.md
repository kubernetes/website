## Kubernetes Blog guidelines

All content must be original. The Kubernetes Blog does not post material previously published elsewhere.

Suitable Content (with examples):

- User case studies (Yahoo Japan, Bitmovin)
- New Kubernetes capabilities (5-days-of-k8s)
- Kubernetes projects updates (kompose)
- Updates from Special Interest Groups (SIG-OpenStack)
- Tutorials and walkthroughs (PostgreSQL w/ StatefulSets)
- Thought leadership around Kubernetes (CaaS, the foundation for next generation PaaS)
- Kubernetes Partner OSS integration (Fission)

Unsuitable Content:

- Vendor product pitches
- Partner updates without an integration and customer story
- Syndicated posts (language translations are permitted)

## Create a blog post with a form

Open the [Kubernetes Blog Submission](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch_phFYMTYlrTDuYziURP6nLMijoXx_f7sLABEU5gWBtxJHQ/viewform) form, fill it out, and click Submit.

## Create a post by opening a pull request

### Add a new Markdown file

Add a new Markdown (`*.md`) to `/blog/_posts/`.

Name the file using the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md
```
For example:
```
2015-03-20-Welcome-to-the-Kubernetes-Blog.md
```

### Add front matter to the file

Add the following block to the top of the new file:
```
---
layout: blog
title: <title>
date:  <date>
---
```

For example:
```
---
layout: blog
title: Welcome to the Kubernetes Blog!
date:  Saturday, March 20, 2015
---
```

### Add content to the file

The preferred image format is SVG.

Add the proposed date of your blog post to the title of any image files the post contains:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-image.svg
```
