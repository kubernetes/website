[CoreOS Fest 2016](https://coreos.com/fest/) will bring together the container and open source distributed systems community, including many thought leaders in the Kubernetes space. It is the second annual CoreOS community conference, held for the first time in Berlin on May 9th and 10th. CoreOS believes Kubernetes is the container orchestration component to deliver GIFEE (Google’s Infrastructure for Everyone Else).  

At this year’s CoreOS Fest, there are tracks dedicated to Kubernetes where you’ll hear about various topics ranging from Kubernetes performance and scalability, continuous delivery and Kubernetes, rktnetes, stackanetes and more. In addition, there will be a variety of talks, from introductory workshops to deep-dives into all things containers and related software.
