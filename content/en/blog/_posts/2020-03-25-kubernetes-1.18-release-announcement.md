**Authors:** [Kubernetes 1.18 Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.18/release_team.md)

We're pleased to announce the delivery of Kubernetes 1.18, our first release of 2020! Kubernetes 1.18 consists of 38 enhancements: 15 enhancements are moving to stable, 11 enhancements in beta, and 12 enhancements in alpha.

Kubernetes 1.18 is a "fit and finish" release. Significant work has gone into improving beta and stable features to ensure users have a better experience. An equal effort has gone into adding new developments and exciting new features that promise to enhance the user experience even more.
Having almost as many enhancements in alpha, beta, and stable is a great achievement. It shows the tremendous effort made by the community on improving the reliability of Kubernetes as well as continuing to expand its existing functionality.


## Major Themes

### Kubernetes Topology Manager Moves to Beta - Align Up!

A beta feature of Kubernetes in release 1.18,  the [Topology Manager feature](https://github.com/nolancon/website/blob/f4200307260ea3234540ef13ed80de325e1a7267/content/en/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager.md) enables NUMA alignment of CPU and devices (such as SR-IOV VFs) that will allow your workload to run in an environment optimized for low-latency. Prior to the introduction of the Topology Manager, the CPU and Device Manager would make resource allocation decisions independent of each other. This could result in undesirable allocations on multi-socket systems, causing degraded performance on latency critical applications.

### Serverside Apply Introduces Beta 2

Server-side Apply was promoted to Beta in 1.16, but is now introducing a second Beta in 1.18. This new version will track and manage changes to fields of all new Kubernetes objects, allowing you to know what changed your resources and when.


### Extending Ingress with and replacing a deprecated annotation with IngressClass

In Kubernetes 1.18, there are two significant additions to Ingress: A new `pathType` field and a new `IngressClass` resource. The `pathType` field allows specifying how paths should be matched. In addition to the default `ImplementationSpecific` type, there are new `Exact` and `Prefix` path types. 

The `IngressClass` resource is used to describe a type of Ingress within a Kubernetes cluster. Ingresses can specify the class they are associated with by using a new `ingressClassName` field on Ingresses. This new resource and field replace the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation.

### SIG-CLI introduces kubectl alpha debug

SIG-CLI was debating the need for a debug utility for quite some time already. With the development of [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/), it became more obvious how we can support developers with tooling built on top of `kubectl exec`. The addition of the [`kubectl alpha debug` command](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cli/20190805-kubectl-debug.md) (it is alpha but your feedback is more than welcome), allows developers to easily debug their Pods inside the cluster. We think this addition is invaluable.  This command allows one to create a temporary container which runs next to the Pod one is trying to examine, but also attaches to the console for interactive troubleshooting.


### Introducing Windows CSI support alpha for Kubernetes

The alpha version of CSI Proxy for Windows is being released with Kubernetes 1.18. CSI proxy enables CSI Drivers on Windows by allowing containers in Windows to perform privileged storage operations.

### Availability

Kubernetes 1.18 is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.18.0). To get started with Kubernetes, check out these [interactive tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) or run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container ‚Äúnodes‚Äù with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/). You can also easily install 1.18 using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/). 

### Release Team

This release is made possible through the efforts of hundreds of individuals who contributed both technical and non-technical content. Special thanks to the [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.18/release_team.md) led by Jorge Alarcon Ochoa, Site Reliability Engineer at Searchable AI. The 34 release team members coordinated many aspects of the release, from documentation to testing, validation, and feature completeness. 

As the Kubernetes community has grown, our release process represents an amazing demonstration of collaboration in open source software development. Kubernetes continues to gain new users at a rapid pace. This growth creates a positive feedback cycle where more contributors commit code creating a more vibrant ecosystem. Kubernetes has had over [40,000 individual contributors](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/24/overall-project-statistics?orgId=1) to date and an active community of more than 3,000 people.
