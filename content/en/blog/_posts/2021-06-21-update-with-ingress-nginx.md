With all Kubernetes APIs, there is a process to creating, maintaining, and
ultimately deprecating them once they become GA. The networking.k8s.io API group is no
different. With the release of Kubernetes 1.22, The networking.k8s.
io/v1beta1 API version of IngressClass will no longer be served in 
Kubernetes v1.22. The extensions/v1beta1 and networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 API 
versions of Ingress also will no longer be served in v1.22.  This move has been 
in discussion since
[2017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/43214),
[2019](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/) with 
1.16 Kubernetes API deprecations,and most recently in 
KEP-1453: 
[Graduate Ingress API to GA](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/1453-ingress-api#122).

During community meetings, the networking Special Interest Group has decided to continue 
supporting Kubernetes versions older than 1.22 with Ingress version 0.47.0. 
Support for Ingress-NGINX will continue for six months after Kubernetes 1.22 
is released. Any additional bug fixes and CVEs for Ingress-NGINX will be 
addressed on a need-by-need basis.

Ingress-NGINX will have separate branches and releases of Ingress-NGINX to 
support this model, mirroring the Kubernetes project process. Future 
releases of the Ingress-NGINX project will track and support the latest 
versions of Kubernetes.

Kubernetes Version  | Ingress-NGINX version | Support Notes
:-------------------|:----------------------|:------------
`1.22`              | TBD                   | On Going
`1.21`              | `v0.47.0`             | On Going but only CVE and crashes
`1.20`              | `v0.47.0`             | On Going but only CVE and crashes
`1.19`              | `v0.47.0`             | Support will drop 6 months after 1.22 release

Because of the updates in Kubernetes 1.22, **v0.47.0** will not work with 
Kubernetes 1.22. 

# What do I need to do

The team is currently in the process of upgrading ingress-nginx to support 
the v1 migration, you can track the progress 
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/7156).  
Feature requests are being frozen until the v1 update is completed. 

In the meantime to ensure no compatibility issues: 

* Update to the latest version of Ingress-NGINX; currently
  [v0.47.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/releases/tag/controller-v0.47.0) 
* After Kubernetes 1.22 is released, ensure you are using the latest version of 
  Ingress-NGINX that supports the stable APIs for Ingress and IngressClass.

The communityâ€™s feedback and support in this effort is welcome. The
Ingress-NGINX Sub-project regularly holds community meetings where we discuss
this and other issues facing the project. For more information on the sub-project, 
please see [SIG Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network).
