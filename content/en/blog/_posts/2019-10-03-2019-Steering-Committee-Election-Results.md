The [2019 Steering Committee Election] is a landmark milestone for the
Kubernetes project. The initial bootstrap committee is graduating to emeritus
and the committee has now shrunk to its final allocation of seven seats. All
members of the Steering Committee are now fully elected by the Kubernetes
Community.

Moving forward elections will elect either 3 or 4 people to the committee for
two-year terms.


## **Results**

The Kubernetes Steering Committee Election is now complete and the following
candidates came ahead to secure two-year terms that start immediately
(in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

* **Christoph Blecker ([@cblecker]), Red Hat**
* **Derek Carr ([@derekwaynecarr]), Red Hat**
* **Nikhita Raghunath ([@nikhita]), Loodse**
* **Paris Pittman ([@parispittman])**, **Google**

They join Aaron Crickenberger ([@spiffxp]), Google; Davanum Srinivas ([@dims]),
VMware; and Timothy St. Clair ([@timothysc]), VMware, to round out the committee.
The seats held by Aaron, Davanum, and Timothy will be up for election around
this time next year.
