The [2020 Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/elections/2020) is now complete. In 2019, the committee arrived at its final allocation of 7 seats, 3 of which were up for election in 2020. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.

This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their [charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/charter.md).

## Results

Congratulations to the elected committee members whose two year terms begin immediately (listed in alphabetical order by GitHub handle):

* **Davanum Srinivas ([@dims](https://github.com/dims)), VMware**
* **Jordan Liggitt ([@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)), Google**
* **Bob Killen ([@mrbobbytables](https://github.com/mrbobbytables)), Google**
