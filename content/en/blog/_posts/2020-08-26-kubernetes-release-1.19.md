**Authors:** [Kubernetes 1.19 Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.19/release_team.md)

Finally, we have arrived with Kubernetes 1.19, the second release for 2020, and by far the longest release cycle lasting 20 weeks in total. It consists of 33 enhancements: 12 enhancements are moving to stable, 18 enhancements in beta, and 13 enhancements in alpha. 

The 1.19 release was quite different from a regular release due to COVID-19, the George Floyd protests, and several other global events that we experienced as a release team. Due to these events, we made the decision to adjust our timeline and allow the SIGs, Working Groups, and contributors more time to get things done. The extra time also allowed for people to take time to focus on their lives outside of the Kubernetes project, and ensure their mental wellbeing was in a good place. 

Contributors are the heart of Kubernetes, not the other way around. The Kubernetes code of conduct asks that people be excellent to one another and despite the unrest in our world, we saw nothing but greatness and humility from the community. 

## Major Themes
### Increase Kubernetes support window to one year

A survey conducted in early 2019 by the [Long Term Support (LTS) working group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-lts#readme) showed that a significant subset of Kubernetes end-users fail to upgrade within the current 9-month support period. 
This, and other responses from the survey, suggest that 30% of users would be able to keep their deployments on supported versions if the patch support period were extended to 12-14 months. This appears to be true regardless of whether the users are on self build or commercially vendored distributions. An extension would thus lead to more than 80% of users being on supported versions, instead of the 50-60% we have now.
A yearly support period provides the cushion end-users appear to desire, and is more in harmony with familiar annual planning cycles.
From Kubernetes version 1.19 on, the support window will be extended to one year.

### Storage capacity tracking 

Traditionally, the Kubernetes scheduler was based on the assumptions that additional persistent storage is available everywhere in the cluster and has infinite capacity. Topology constraints addressed the first point, but up to now pod scheduling was still done without considering that the remaining storage capacity may not be enough to start a new pod. [Storage capacity tracking](/docs/concepts/storage/storage-capacity/), a new alpha feature, addresses that by adding an API for a CSI driver to report storage capacity and uses that information in the Kubernetes scheduler when choosing a node for a pod. This feature serves as a stepping stone for supporting dynamic provisioning for local volumes and other volume types that are more capacity constrained.

#### Generic ephemeral volumes
Kubernetes provides volume plugins whose lifecycle is tied to a pod and can be used as scratch space (e.g. the builtin `emptydir` volume type) or to load some data in to a pod (e.g. the builtin `configmap` and `secret` volume types, or “CSI inline volumes”). The new [generic ephemeral volumes](/docs/concepts/storage/ephemeral-volumes/#generic-ephemeral-volumes) alpha feature allows any existing storage driver that supports dynamic provisioning to be used as an ephemeral volume with the volume’s lifecycle bound to the Pod.
It can be used to provide scratch storage that is different from the root disk, for example persistent memory, or a separate local disk on that node.
All StorageClass parameters for volume provisioning are supported.
All features supported with PersistentVolumeClaims are supported, such as storage capacity tracking, snapshots and restore, and volume resizing.

#### CSI Volume Health Monitoring
The alpha version of CSI health monitoring is being released with Kubernetes 1.19. This feature enables CSI Drivers to share abnormal volume conditions from the underlying storage systems with Kubernetes so that they can be reported as events on PVCs or Pods. This feature serves as a stepping stone towards programmatic detection and resolution of individual volume health issues by Kubernetes.

### Ingress graduates to General Availability
In terms of moving the Ingress API towards GA, the API itself has been available in beta for so long that it has attained de facto GA status through usage and adoption (both by users and by load balancer / ingress controller providers). Abandoning it without a full replacement is not a viable approach. It is clearly a useful API and captures a non-trivial set of use cases. At this point, it seems more prudent to declare the current API as something the community will support as a V1, codifying its status, while working on either a V2 Ingress API or an entirely different API with a superset of features. 

### Structured logging
Before v1.19, logging in the Kubernetes control plane couldn't guarantee any uniform structure for log messages and references to Kubernetes objects in those logs. This makes parsing, processing, storing, querying and analyzing logs hard and forces administrators and developers to rely on ad-hoc solutions in most cases based on some regular expressions. Due to those problems any analytical solution based on those logs is hard to implement and maintain.

#### New klog methods
This Kubernetes release introduces new methods to the _klog_ library that provide a more structured interface for formatting log messages. Each existing formatted log method (`Infof`, `Errorf`) is now matched by a structured method (`InfoS`, `ErrorS`). The new logging methods accept log messages as a first argument and a list of key-values pairs as a variadic second argument. This approach allows incremental adoption of structured logging without converting **all** of Kubernetes to a new API at one time.

### Client TLS certificate rotation for kubelet

A kubelet authenticates the kubelet to the kube-apiserver using a private key and certificate. The certificate is supplied to the kubelet when it is first booted, via an out-of-cluster mechanism. Since Kubernetes v1.8, clusters have included a (beta) process for obtaining the initial cert/key pair and rotating it as expiration of the certificate approaches. In Kubernetes v1.19 this graduates to stable. 

During the kubelet start-up sequence, the filesystem is scanned for an existing cert/key pair, which is managed by the certificate manager. In the case that a cert/key is available it will be loaded. If not, the kubelet checks its config file for an encoded certificate value or a file reference in the kubeconfig. If the certificate is a bootstrap certificate, this will be used to generate a key, create a certificate signing request and request a signed certificate from the API server.

When an expiration approaches the cert manager takes care of providing the correct certificate, generating new private keys and requesting new certificates. With the kubelet requesting certificates be signed as part of its boot sequence, and on an ongoing basis, certificate signing requests from the kubelet need to be auto approved to make cluster administration manageable.

To get started with Kubernetes, check out these [interactive tutorials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/) or run local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes” with [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes in Docker). You can also easily install 1.19 using [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/). 

## Release Team
This release is made possible through the efforts of hundreds of individuals who contributed both technical and non-technical content. Special thanks to the [release team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.19/release_team.md) led by Taylor Dolezal, Senior Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. The 34 release team members coordinated many aspects of the release, from documentation to testing, validation, and feature completeness. 

As the Kubernetes community has grown, our release process represents an amazing demonstration of collaboration in open source software development. Kubernetes continues to gain new users at a rapid pace. This growth creates a positive feedback cycle where more contributors commit code creating a more vibrant ecosystem. Kubernetes has had over [49,000 individual contributors](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/24/overall-project-statistics?orgId=1) to date and an active community of more than 3,000 people.

## Release Logo
All of you inspired this Kubernetes 1.19 release logo! This release was a bit more of a marathon and a testament to when the world is a wild place, we can come together and do unbelievable things.

## The Long Run
The release was also different from the enhancements side of things. Traditionally, we have had 3-4 weeks between the call for enhancements and Enhancements Freeze, which ends the phase in which contributors can acknowledge whether a particular feature will be part of the cycle. This release cycle, being unique, we had five weeks for the same milestone. The extended duration gave the contributors more time to plan and decide about the graduation of their respective features.

The milestone until which contributors implement the features was extended from the usual five weeks to 7 weeks. Contributors were provided with 40% more time to work on their features, resulting in reduced fatigue and more to think through about the implementation. We also noticed a considerable reduction in last-minute hustles. There were also a lesser number of exception requests this cycle - 6 compared to 14 the previous release cycle.
