The 2018 North American Kubernetes Contributor Summit to be hosted right before
[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon][kubecon] Seattle is shaping up to be the largest yet.
It is an event that brings together new and current contributors alike to
connect and share face-to-face; and serves as an opportunity for existing
contributors to help shape the future of community development. For new
community members, it offers a welcoming space to learn, explore and put the
contributor workflow to practice.

Unlike previous Contributor Summits, the event now spans two-days with a more
relaxed ‘hallway’ track and general Contributor get-together to be hosted from
5-8pm on Sunday December 9th at the [Garage Lounge and Gaming Hall][garage], just
a short walk away from the Convention Center. There, contributors can enjoy
billiards, bowling, trivia and more; accompanied by a variety of food and drink.

Things pick up the following day, Monday the 10th with three separate tracks: 

### New contributor workshop
A half day workshop aimed at getting new and first time contributors onboarded
and comfortable with working within the Kubernetes Community. Staying for the
duration is required; this is not a workshop you can drop into. 

### Current contributor track
Reserved for those that are actively engaged with the development of the
project; the Current Contributor Track includes Talks, Workshops, Birds of a
Feather, Unconferences, Steering Committee Sessions, and more! Keep an eye on
the [schedule in GitHub][schedule] as content is frequently being updated.

### Docs sprint

SIG Docs will have a curated list of issues and challenges to be tackled closer
to the event date.

## How To Register {#to-register}

To register for the Contributor Summit, see the [Registration section of the
Event Details in GitHub][register]. Please note that registrations are being
reviewed. If you select the “Current Contributor Track” and are not an active
contributor, you will be asked to attend the New Contributor Workshop, or asked
to be put on a waitlist. With thousands of contributors and only 300 spots, we
need to make sure the right folks are in the room.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to
the Contributor Summit Events Team at community@kubernetes.io.

Look forward to seeing everyone there!
