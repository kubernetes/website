While the Kubernetes project is only five years old, we’re already going into our
9th Contributor Summit this November in San Diego before KubeCon + CloudNativeCon.
The rapid increase is thanks to adding European and Asian Contributor Summits to
the North American events we’ve done previously. We will continue to run Contributor
Summits across the globe, as it is important that our contributor base grows in
all forms of diversity.

Kubernetes has a large distributed remote contributing team, from [individuals and
organizations] all over the world. The Contributor Summits give the community three
chances a year to get together, work on community topics, and have hallway track
time. The upcoming San Diego summit is expected to bring over 450 attendees, and
will contain multiple tracks with something for everyone. The focus will be around
contributor growth and sustainability. We're going to stop here with capacity for
future summits; we want this event to offer value to individuals and the project.
We've heard from past summit attendee feedback that getting work done, learning,
and meeting folks face to face is a priority. By capping attendance and offering
the contributor gatherings in more locations, it will help us achieve those goals.

This summit is unique as we’ve taken big moves on sustaining ourselves, the
contributor experience events team. Taking a page from the release team’s playbook,
we have added additional core team and shadow roles making it a natural mentoring
(watching+doing) relationship. The shadows are expected to fill another role at
one of the three events in 2020, and core team members to take the lead.
In preparation for this team, we’ve open sourced our [rolebooks, guidelines,
best practices] and opened up our [meetings] and [project board]. Our team makes up
many parts of the Kubernetes project and takes care of making sure all voices
are represented.

Are you at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon but can’t make it to the summit? Check out
the [SIG Intro and Deep Dive sessions] during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to
participate in Q&A and hear what’s up with each Special interest Group (SIG).
We’ll also record all of Contributor Summit’s presentation sessions, take notes
in discussions, and share it back with you, after the event is complete.

We hope to see you all at Kubernetes Contributor Summit San Diego, make sure you
head over and [register right now]! This event will sell out - here’s your warning.
