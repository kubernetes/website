First of all, **THANK YOU** to everyone who made the Kubernetes Contributor Summit in Barcelona possible. We had an amazing team of volunteers tasked with planning and executing the event, and it was so much fun meeting and talking to all new and current contributors during the main event and the pre-event celebration.

Contributor Summit in Barcelona kicked off KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in a big way as it was the **largest contributor summit** to date with 331 people signed up, and only 9 didn't pick up their badges!

## Contributor Celebration

Sunday evening before the main event we held a **Contributor Celebration**, which was very well attended. We hope that all new and current contributors felt welcome and enjoyed the food, the music, and the company.

## New Contributor Workshops

We had over **130 people registered** for the New Contributor Workshops. This year the workshops were divided into _101-level content_ for people who were not familiar with contributing to an open source project, and _201-level content_ for those who were.

The workshops contained overviews of what SIGs are, deep-dives into the codebase, test builds of the Kubernetes project, and real contributions.

Did you miss something during the workshops? We now have them [published on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69nYSiGNLP2WTJ6P8sQenhf0RY-JqF5L), with added closed captioning!

## SIG Face-to-Face

We also tried a new thing for Barcelona, the SIG Face-to-Face meetings. We had **over 170 people** registered to attend the 11 SIG and one subproject meetings throughout the day, going over what they're working on and what they want to do in the near future.

## SIG Meet and Greet

At the end of the summit, both new and current contributors had a chance to sit down with SIG chairs and members. The goal of this was to make sure that contributors got to know even more individuals in the project, hear what some of the SIGs actually do, and sign up to be a part of them and learn more.
