**Author**: The 1.13 [Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.13/release_team.md)

We’re pleased to announce the delivery of Kubernetes 1.13, our fourth and final release of 2018!

Kubernetes 1.13 has been one of the shortest releases to date at 10 weeks. This release continues to focus on stability and extensibility of Kubernetes with three major features graduating to general availability this cycle in the areas of Storage and Cluster Lifecycle. Notable features graduating in this release include: simplified cluster management with kubeadm, Container Storage Interface (CSI), and CoreDNS as the default DNS.

These stable graduations are an important milestone for users and operators in terms of setting support expectations. In addition, there’s a continual and steady stream of internal improvements and new alpha features that are made available to the community in this release. These features are discussed in the “additional notable features” section below.

Let’s dive into the key features of this release:

## Simplified Kubernetes Cluster Management with kubeadm in GA

Most people who have gotten hands-on with Kubernetes have at some point been hands-on with kubeadm. It's an essential tool for managing the cluster lifecycle, from creation to configuration to upgrade; and now kubeadm is officially GA. [kubeadm](/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/) handles the bootstrapping of production clusters on existing hardware and configuring the core Kubernetes components in a best-practice-manner to providing a secure yet easy joining flow for new nodes and supporting easy upgrades. What’s notable about this GA release are the now graduated advanced features, specifically around pluggability and configurability. The scope of kubeadm is to be a toolbox for both admins and automated, higher-level system and this release is a significant step in that direction.

## Container Storage Interface (CSI) Goes GA

The Container Storage Interface ([CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface)) is now GA after being introduced as alpha in v1.9 and beta in v1.10. With CSI, the Kubernetes volume layer becomes truly extensible. This provides an opportunity for third party storage providers to write plugins that interoperate with Kubernetes without having to touch the core code. The [specification itself](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) has also reached a 1.0 status.

With CSI now stable, plugin authors are developing storage plugins out of core, at their own pace. You can find a list of sample and production drivers in the [CSI Documentation](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html).

## CoreDNS is Now the Default DNS Server for Kubernetes

In 1.11, we announced CoreDNS had reached General Availability for DNS-based service discovery. In 1.13, [CoreDNS is now replacing kube-dns as the default DNS server](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/566) for Kubernetes. CoreDNS is a general-purpose, authoritative DNS server that provides a backwards-compatible, but extensible, integration with Kubernetes. CoreDNS has fewer moving parts than the previous DNS server, since it’s a single executable and a single process, and supports flexible use cases by creating custom DNS entries. It’s also written in Go making it memory-safe.

CoreDNS is now the recommended DNS solution for Kubernetes 1.13+. The project has switched the common test infrastructure to use CoreDNS by default and we recommend users switching as well. KubeDNS will still be supported for at least one more release, but it's time to start planning your migration. Many OSS installer tools have already made the switch, including [Kubeadm in 1.11](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/07/10/coredns-ga-for-kubernetes-cluster-dns/). If you use a hosted solution, please work with your vendor to understand how this will impact you.

## Additional Notable Feature Updates

[Support for 3rd party device monitoring plugins](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/606) has been introduced as an alpha feature. This removes current device-specific knowledge from the kubelet to enable future use-cases requiring device-specific knowledge to be out-of-tree.

[Kubelet Device Plugin Registration](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/595) is graduating to stable. This creates a common Kubelet plugin discovery model that can be used by different types of node-level plugins, such as device plugins, CSI and CNI, to establish communication channels with Kubelet.

[Topology Aware Volume Scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/490) is now stable. This make the scheduler aware of a Pod's volume's topology constraints, such as zone or node.

[APIServer DryRun](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/576) is graduating to beta. This moves "apply" and declarative object management from `kubectl` to the `apiserver` in order to fix many of the existing bugs that can't be fixed today.

[Kubectl Diff](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/491) is graduating to beta. This allows users to run a `kubectl` command to view the difference between a locally declared object configuration and the current state of a live object.

[Raw block device using persistent volume source](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/351) is graduating to beta. This makes raw block devices (non-networked) available for consumption via a Persistent Volume Source.
