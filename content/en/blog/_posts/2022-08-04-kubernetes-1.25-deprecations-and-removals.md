As Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.

## The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process

The Kubernetes project has a well-documented [deprecation policy](/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/) for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed. Removed APIs are no longer available in the current version, at which point you must migrate to using the replacement.

* Generally available (GA) or stable API versions may be marked as deprecated but must not be removed within a major version of Kubernetes. 
* Beta or pre-release API versions must be supported for 3 releases after deprecation. 
* Alpha or experimental API versions may be removed in any release without prior deprecation notice.

Whether an API is removed as a result of a feature graduating from beta to stable or because that API simply did not succeed, all removals comply with this deprecation policy. Whenever an API is removed, migration options are communicated in the documentation. 

## A note about PodSecurityPolicy {#podsecuritypolicy-removal}

In Kubernetes v1.25, we will be removing PodSecurityPolicy [after its deprecation in v1.21](/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/). PodSecurityPolicy has served us honorably, but its complex and often confusing usage necessitated changes, which unfortunately would have been breaking changes. To address this, it is being removed in favor of a replacement, Pod Security Admission, which is graduating to stable in this release as well. If you are currently relying on PodSecurityPolicy, follow the instructions for [migration to Pod Security Admission](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/migrate-from-psp/).

## Major Changes for Kubernetes v1.25

Kubernetes v1.25 will include several major changes, in addition to the removal of PodSecurityPolicy.

### [CSI Migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/625)

The effort to  move the in-tree volume plugins to out-of-tree CSI drivers continues, with the core CSI Migration feature going GA in v1.25. This is an important step towards removing the in-tree volume plugins entirely.

### Deprecations and removals for storage drivers

Several volume plugins are being deprecated or removed.

[GlusterFS will be deprecated in v1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3446). While a CSI driver was built for it, it has not been maintained. The possibility of migration to a compatible CSI driver [was discussed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/100897), but a decision was ultimately made to begin the deprecation of the GlusterFS plugin from in-tree drivers. The [Portworx in-tree volume plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2589) is also being deprecated with this release. The Flocker, Quobyte, and StorageOS in-tree volume plugins are being removed.

[Flocker](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111618), [Quobyte](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111619), and [StorageOS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111620) in-tree volume plugins will be removed in v1.25. Users of these plugins need to switch to an equivalent CSI driver or an alternate storage provider.

### [Change to vSphere version support](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/111255)

From Kubernetes v1.25, the in-tree vSphere volume driver will not support any vSphere release before 7.0u2. Once Kubernetes v1.25 is released, check the v1.25 detailed release notes for more advice on how to handle this.

### [Cleaning up IPTables Chain Ownership](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3178)

On Linux, Kubernetes (usually) creates iptables chains to ensure that network packets reach
Although these chains and their names have been an internal implementation detail, some tooling
has relied upon that behavior.
will only support for internal Kubernetes use cases. Starting with v1.25, the Kubelet will gradually move towards not creating the following iptables chains in the `nat` table:

  - `KUBE-MARK-DROP`
  - `KUBE-MARK-MASQ`
  - `KUBE-POSTROUTING`

This change will be phased in via the `IPTablesCleanup` feature gate. Although this is not formally a deprecation, some end users have come to rely on specific internal behavior of `kube-proxy`. The Kubernetes project overall wants to make it clear that depending on these internal details is not supported, and that future implementations will change their behavior here.
    
## Looking ahead

The official [list of API removals planned for Kubernetes 1.26](/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#v1-26) is:

* The beta FlowSchema and PriorityLevelConfiguration APIs (flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1)
* The beta HorizontalPodAutoscaler API (autoscaling/v2beta2)

    
### Want to know more?
Deprecations are announced in the Kubernetes release notes. You can see the announcements of pending deprecations in the release notes for:
* [Kubernetes 1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.21.md#deprecation)
* [Kubernetes 1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#deprecation)
* [Kubernetes 1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.23.md#deprecation)
* [Kubernetes 1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#deprecation)
* We will formally announce the deprecations that come with [Kubernetes 1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.25.md#deprecation) as part of the CHANGELOG for that release.
