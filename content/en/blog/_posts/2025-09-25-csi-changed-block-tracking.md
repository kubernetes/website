We're excited to announce the alpha support for a _changed block tracking_ mechanism. This enhances
the Kubernetes storage ecosystem by providing an efficient way for
[CSI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#csi) storage drivers to identify changed
blocks in PersistentVolume snapshots. With a driver that can use the feature, you could benefit
from faster and more resource-efficient backup operations.

If you're eager to try this feature, you can [skip to the Getting Started section](#getting-started).

## What is changed block tracking?

Changed block tracking enables storage systems to identify and track modifications at the block level
between snapshots, eliminating the need to scan entire volumes during backup operations. The
improvement is a change to the Container Storage Interface (CSI), and also to the storage support
in Kubernetes itself.
With the alpha feature enabled, your cluster can:

- Identify allocated blocks within a CSI volume snapshot
- Determine changed blocks between two snapshots of the same volume
- Streamline backup operations by focusing only on changed data blocks

For Kubernetes users managing large datasets, this API enables significantly more efficient
backup processes. Backup applications can now focus only on the blocks that have changed,
rather than processing entire volumes.

{{< note >}}
As of now, the Changed Block Tracking API is supported only for block volumes and not for
file volumes. CSI drivers that manage file-based storage systems will not be able to
implement this capability.

## Benefits of changed block tracking support in Kubernetes

As Kubernetes adoption grows for stateful workloads managing critical data, the need for efficient
backup solutions becomes increasingly important. Traditional full backup approaches face challenges with:

- _Long backup windows_: Full volume backups can take hours for large datasets, making it difficult
   to complete within maintenance windows.
- _High resource utilization_: Backup operations consume substantial network bandwidth and I/O
   resources, especially for large data volumes and data-intensive applications.
- _Increased storage costs_: Repetitive full backups store redundant data, causing storage
   requirements to grow linearly even when only a small percentage of data actually changes between
   backups.

The Changed Block Tracking API addresses these challenges by providing native Kubernetes support for
incremental backup capabilities through the CSI interface.

## Key components

The implementation consists of three primary components:

1. _CSI SnapshotMetadata Service API_: An API, offered by gRPC, that provides volume
   snapshot and changed block data.
2. _SnapshotMetadataService API_: A Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) that
   advertises CSI driver metadata service availability and connection details to
   cluster clients.
3. _External Snapshot Metadata Sidecar_: An intermediary component that connects CSI
   drivers to backup applications via a standardized gRPC interface.

## Implementation requirements

### Storage provider responsibilities

If you're an author of a storage integration with Kubernetes and want to support the changed block tracking feature, you must implement specific requirements:

1. _Implement CSI RPCs_: Storage providers need to implement the `SnapshotMetadata` service as defined in the [CSI specifications protobuf](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/master/csi.proto). This service requires server-side streaming implementations for the following RPCs:

   - `GetMetadataAllocated`: For identifying allocated blocks in a snapshot
   - `GetMetadataDelta`: For determining changed blocks between two snapshots

2. _Storage backend capabilities_: Ensure the storage backend has the capability to track and report block-level changes.

3. _Deploy external components_: Integrate with the `external-snapshot-metadata` sidecar to expose the snapshot metadata service.

4. _Register custom resource_: Register the `SnapshotMetadataService` resource using a CustomResourceDefinition and create a `SnapshotMetadataService` custom resource that advertises the availability of the metadata service and provides connection details.

5. _Support error handling_: Implement proper error handling for these RPCs according to the CSI specification requirements.

### Backup solution responsibilities

A backup solution looking to leverage this feature must:

1. _Set up authentication_: The backup application must provide a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token when using the
   [Kubernetes SnapshotMetadataService API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-storage/3314-csi-changed-block-tracking#the-kubernetes-snapshotmetadata-service-api).
   Appropriate access grants, such as RBAC RoleBindings, must be established to authorize the backup application
   ServiceAccount to obtain such tokens.

2. _Implement streaming client-side code_: Develop clients that implement the streaming gRPC APIs defined in the
   [schema.proto](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/blob/main/proto/schema.proto) file.
   Specifically:
   - Implement streaming client code for `GetMetadataAllocated` and `GetMetadataDelta` methods
   - Handle server-side streaming responses efficiently as the metadata comes in chunks
   - Process the `SnapshotMetadataResponse` message format with proper error handling

   The `external-snapshot-metadata` GitHub repository provides a convenient
   [iterator](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshot-metadata/tree/master/pkg/iterator)
   support package to simplify client implementation.

3. _Handle large dataset streaming_: Design clients to efficiently handle large streams of block metadata that
   could be returned for volumes with significant changes.

4. _Optimize backup processes_: Modify backup workflows to use the changed block metadata to identify and only
   transfer changed blocks to make backups more efficient, reducing both backup duration and resource consumption.


## Getting started

To use changed block tracking in your cluster:

1. Ensure your CSI driver supports volume snapshots and implements the snapshot metadata capabilities with the required `external-snapshot-metadata` sidecar
2. Make sure the SnapshotMetadataService custom resource is registered using CRD
3. Verify the presence of a SnapshotMetadataService custom resource for your CSI driver
4. Create clients that can access the API using appropriate authentication (via Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens)

The API provides two main functions:

- `GetMetadataAllocated`: Lists blocks allocated in a single snapshot
- `GetMetadataDelta`: Lists blocks changed between two snapshots

## Whatâ€™s next?

Depending on feedback and adoption, the Kubernetes developers hope to push the CSI Snapshot Metadata implementation to Beta in the future releases.
