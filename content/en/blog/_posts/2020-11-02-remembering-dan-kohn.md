**Author**: The Kubernetes Steering Committee

Dan Kohn was instrumental in getting Kubernetes and CNCF community to where it is today. He shared our values, motivations, enthusiasm, community spirit, and helped the Kubernetes community to become the best that it could be. Dan loved getting people together to solve problems big and small. He enabled people to grow their individual scope in the community which often helped launch their career in open source software.

Dan built a coalition around the nascent Kubernetes project and turned that into a cornerstone to build the larger cloud native space. He loved challenges, especially ones where the payoff was great like building worldwide communities, spreading the love of open source, and helping diverse, underprivileged communities and students to get a head start in technology.

Our heart goes out to his family. Thank you, Dan, for bringing your boys to events in India and elsewhere as we got to know how great you were as a father. Dan, your thoughts and ideas will help us make progress in our journey as a community. Thank you for your life's work!

If Dan has made an impact on you in some way, please consider adding a memory of him in his [CNCF memorial](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/master/dan-kohn.md).
