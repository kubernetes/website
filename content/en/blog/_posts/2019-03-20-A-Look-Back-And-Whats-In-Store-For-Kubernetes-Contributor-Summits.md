As our contributing community grows in great numbers, with more than 16,000 contributors this year across 150+ GitHub repositories, it’s important to provide face to face connections for our large distributed teams to have opportunities for collaboration and learning. In [Contributor Experience], our methodology with planning events is a lot like our documentation; we build from personas -- interests, skills, and motivators to name a few. This way we ensure there is valuable content and learning for everyone.

We build the contributor summits around you:

* New Contributor
* Current Contributor
  * docs
  * code
  * community management
* [Subproject OWNERs] - aka maintainers in other OSS circles.
* Special Interest Group (SIG) / Working Group (WG) [Chair or Tech Lead]
* Active Contributors
* Casual Contributors

These personas combined with ample feedback from previous events, produce the   altogether experience that welcomed over 600 contributors in Copenhagen (May), Shanghai(November), and Seattle(December) in 2018. Seattle's event drew over 300+ contributors, equal to Shanghai and Copenhagen combined, for the 6th contributor event in Kubernetes history. In true Kubernetes fashion, we expect another record breaking year of attendance. We've pre-ordered 900+ [contributor patches], a tradition, and we are   looking forward to giving them to you!

With that said…

**Save the Dates:**  
Barcelona: May 19th (evening) and 20th (all day)  
Shanghai: June 24th (all day)  
San Diego: November 18th, 19th, and activities in KubeCon/CloudNativeCon week

In an effort of continual improvement, here's what to expect from us this year:

* Large new contributor workshops and contributor socials at all three events expected to break previous attendance records
* A multiple track event in San Diego for all contributor types including workshops, birds of a feather, lightning talks and more
* Addition of a “201” / “Intermediate” edition of the new contributor workshop in San Diego
* [An event website]!
* Follow along with updates: kubernetes-dev@googlegroups.com is our main communication hub as always; however, we will also blog here, our [Thursday Kubernetes Community Meeting], [twitter], SIG meetings, event site, discuss.kubernetes.io, and #contributor-summit on Slack.
* Opportunities to get involved: We still have 2019 roles available!
Reach out to Contributor Experience via community@kubernetes.io, stop by a Wednesday SIG update meeting, or catch us on Slack (#sig-contribex).
