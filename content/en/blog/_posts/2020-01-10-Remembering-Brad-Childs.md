Last year, the Kubernetes family lost one of its own. Brad Childs was a
SIG Storage chair and long time contributor to the project. Brad worked on a
number of features in storage and was known as much for his friendliness and
sense of humor as for his technical contributions and leadership.

We recently spent time remembering Brad at Kubecon NA:

- [A Tribute to Bradley Childs](https://youtu.be/4eI2PTAJ-sE)
- [CNCF Memorial](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/master/bradley-childs.md)

Our hearts go out to Brad’s friends and family and others whose lives he touched
inside and outside the Kubernetes community.

Thank you for everything, Brad. We’ll miss you.
