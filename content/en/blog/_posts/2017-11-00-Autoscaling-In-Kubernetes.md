Kubernetes allows developers to automatically adjust cluster sizes and the number of pod replicas based on current traffic and load. These adjustments reduce the amount of unused nodes, saving money and resources. In this talk, Marcin Wielgus of Google walks you through the current state of pod and node autoscaling in Kubernetes: .how it works, and how to use it, including best practices for deployments in production applications.
