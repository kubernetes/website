_Editor’s note: This week we’re featuring [Kubernetes Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/wiki/Special-Interest-Groups-(SIGs)); Today’s post is by the SIG-ClusterOps team whose mission is to promote operability and interoperability of Kubernetes clusters -- to listen, help & escalate._  

We think Kubernetes is an awesome way to run applications at scale! Unfortunately, there's a bootstrapping problem: we need good ways to build secure & reliable scale environments around Kubernetes. While some parts of the platform administration leverage the platform (cool!), there are fundamental operational topics that need to be addressed and questions (like upgrade and conformance) that need to be answered.  

**Enter Cluster Ops SIG – the community members who work under the platform to keep it running.**  

Our objective for Cluster Ops is to be a person-to-person community first, and a source of opinions, documentation, tests and scripts second. That means we dedicate significant time and attention to simply comparing notes about what is working and discussing real operations. Those interactions give us data to form opinions. It also means we can use real-world experiences to inform the project.  

We aim to become the forum for operational review and feedback about the project. For Kubernetes to succeed, operators need to have a significant voice in the project by weekly participation and collecting survey data. We're not trying to create a single opinion about ops, but we do want to create a coordinated resource for collecting operational feedback for the project. As a single recognized group, operators are more accessible and have a bigger impact.  

**What about real world deliverables?**  

We've got plans for tangible results too. We’re already driving toward concrete deliverables like reference architectures, tool catalogs, community deployment notes and conformance testing. Cluster Ops wants to become the clearing house for operational resources. We're going to do it based on real world experience and battle tested deployments.  

**Connect with us.**  

Cluster Ops can be hard work – don't do it alone. We're here to listen, to help when we can and escalate when we can't. Join the conversation at:  


- Chat with us on the [Cluster Ops Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-cluster-ops/)
- Email us at the [Cluster Ops SIG email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-cluster-ops)

The Cluster Ops Special Interest Group meets weekly at 13:00PT on Thursdays, you can join us via the [video hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/google.com/sig-cluster-ops) and see latest [meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IhN5v6MjcAUrvLd9dAWtKcGWBWSaRU8DNyPiof3gYMY/edit) for agendas and topics covered.
