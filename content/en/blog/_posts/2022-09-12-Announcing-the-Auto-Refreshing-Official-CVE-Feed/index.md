title: Announcing the Auto-refreshing Official Kubernetes CVE Feed

**Author**: Pushkar Joglekar (VMware)

A long-standing request from the Kubernetes community has been to have a
programmatic way for end users to keep track of Kubernetes security issues
(also called "CVEs", after the database that tracks public security issues across
different products and vendors). Accompanying the release of Kubernetes v1.25,
we are excited to announce availability of such
a [feed](/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/) as an `alpha`
feature. This blog will cover the background and scope of this new service.

## Motivation

With the growing number of eyes on Kubernetes, the number of CVEs related to
Kubernetes have increased. Although most CVEs that directly, indirectly, or
transitively impact Kubernetes are regularly fixed, there is no single place for
the end users of Kubernetes to programmatically subscribe or pull the data of
fixed CVEs. Current options are either broken or incomplete.

## Scope

### What This Does

Create a periodically auto-refreshing, human and machine-readable list of
official Kubernetes CVEs

### What This Doesn't Do

* Triage and vulnerability disclosure will continue to be done by SRC (Security
  Response Committee).
* Listing CVEs that are identified in build time dependencies and container
  images are out of scope.
* Only official CVEs announced by the Kubernetes SRC will be published in the
  feed.

### Who It's For

* **End Users**: Persons or teams who _use_ Kubernetes to deploy applications
  they own
* **Platform Providers**: Persons or teams who _manage_ Kubernetes clusters
* **Maintainers**: Persons or teams who _create_ and _support_ Kubernetes
  releases through their work in Kubernetes Community - via various Special
  Interest Groups and Committees.

## Implementation Details

A supporting
[contributor blog](https://kubernetes.dev/blog/2022/09/12/k8s-cve-feed-alpha/)
was published that describes in depth on how this CVE feed was implemented to
ensure the feed was reasonably protected against tampering and was automatically
updated after a new CVE was announced.

## What's Next?

In order to graduate this feature, SIG Security
is gathering feedback from end users who are using this alpha feed.

So in order to improve the feed in future Kubernetes Releases, if you have any
feedback, please let us know by adding a comment to
this [tracking issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/1) or
let us know on
[#sig-security-tooling](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C01CUSVMHPY)
Kubernetes Slack channel.
