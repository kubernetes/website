On September 26, 2023, the first day of
[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023](https://www.lfasiallc.com/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-china/),
nearly 50 contributors gathered in Shanghai for the Kubernetes Contributor Summit.

This marked the first in-person offline gathering held in China after three years of the pandemic.

## A joyful meetup

The event began with welcome speeches from [Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kevin-wangzefeng) from Huawei Cloud,
one of the co-chairs of KubeCon, and [Puja](https://github.com/puja108) from Giant Swarm.

Following the opening remarks, the contributors introduced themselves briefly. Most attendees were from China,
while some contributors had made the journey from Europe and the United States specifically for the conference.
Technical experts from companies such as Microsoft, Intel, Huawei, as well as emerging forces like DaoCloud,
were present. Laughter and cheerful voices filled the room, regardless of whether English was spoken with
European or American accents or if conversations were carried out in authentic Chinese language. This created
an atmosphere of comfort, joy, respect, and anticipation. Past contributions brought everyone closer, and
mutual recognition and accomplishments made this offline gathering possible.

The attending contributors were no longer just GitHub IDs; they transformed into vivid faces.
From sitting together and capturing group photos to attempting to identify "Who is who,"
a loosely connected collective emerged. This team structure, although loosely knit and free-spirited,
was established to pursue shared dreams.

As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." Each effort has been diligently documented within
the Kubernetes community contributions. Regardless of the passage of time, the community will
not erase those shining traces. Brilliance can be found in your PRs, issues, or comments.
It can also be seen in the smiling faces captured in meetup photos or heard through stories
passed down among contributors.

## Technical sharing and discussions

Next, there were three technical sharing sessions:

- [sig-multi-cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-multicluster/README.md):
  [Hongcai Ren](https://github.com/RainbowMango), a maintainer of Karmada, provided an introduction to
  the responsibilities and roles of this SIG. Their focus is on designing, discussing, implementing,
  and maintaining APIs, tools, and documentation related to multi-cluster management.
  Cluster Federation, one of Karmada's core concepts, is also part of their work.

- [helmfile](https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile): [yxxhero](https://github.com/yxxhero)
  from [GitLab](https://gitlab.cn/) presented how to deploy Kubernetes manifests declaratively,
  customize configurations, and leverage the latest features of Helm, including Helmfile.

- [sig-scheduling](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-scheduling/README.md):
  [william-wang](https://github.com/william-wang) from Huawei Cloud shared the recent updates and
  future plans of SIG Scheduling. This SIG is responsible for designing, developing, and testing
  components related to Pod scheduling.

Following the sessions, a video featuring a call for contributors by [Sergey Kanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev),
the SIG-Node Chair, was played. The purpose was to encourage more contributors to join the Kubernetes community,
with a special emphasis on the popular SIG-Node.

Lastly, Kevin hosted an Unconference collective discussion session covering topics such as
multi-cluster management, scheduling, elasticity, AI, and more. For detailed minutes of
the Unconference meeting, please refer to <https://docs.qq.com/doc/DY3pLWklzQkhjWHNT>.

## China's contributor statistics

The contributor summit took place in Shanghai, with 90% of the attendees being Chinese.
Within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem, contributions from China have been steadily increasing. Currently:

- Chinese contributors account for 9% of the total.
- Contributions from China make up 11.7% of the overall volume.
- China ranks second globally in terms of contributions.

{{< note >}}
The data is from KubeCon keynotes by Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud Native Computing Foundation,
on September 26, 2023. This probably understates Chinese contributions. A lot of Chinese contributors
use VPNs and may not show up as being from China in the stats accurately.
