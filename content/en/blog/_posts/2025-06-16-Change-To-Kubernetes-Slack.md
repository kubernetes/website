**UPDATE**: We’ve received notice from Salesforce that our Slack workspace **WILL NOT BE DOWNGRADED** on June 20th. Stand by for more details, but for now, there is no urgency to back up private channels or direct messages.

~~Kubernetes Slack will lose its special status and will be changing into a standard free Slack on June 20, 2025~~. Sometime later this year, our community may move to a new platform. If you are responsible for a channel or private channel, or a member of a User Group, you will need to take some actions as soon as you can.

For the last decade, Slack has supported our project with a free customized enterprise account. They have let us know that they can no longer do so, particularly since our Slack is one of the largest and more active ones on the platform. As such, they will be downgrading it to a standard free Slack while we decide on, and implement, other options.

On Friday, June 20, we will be subject to the [feature limitations of free Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/27204752526611-Feature-limitations-on-the-free-version-of-Slack). The primary ones which will affect us will be only retaining 90 days of history, and having to disable several apps and workflows which we are currently using. The Slack Admin team will do their best to manage these limitations.

Responsible channel owners, members of private channels, and members of User Groups should [take some actions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md#what-actions-do-channel-owners-and-user-group-members-need-to-take-soon) to prepare for the upgrade and preserve information as soon as possible.

The CNCF Projects Staff have proposed that our community look at migrating to Discord. Because of existing issues where we have been pushing the limits of Slack, they have already explored what a Kubernetes Discord would look like. Discord would allow us to implement new tools and integrations which would help the community, such as GitHub group membership synchronization. The Steering Committee will discuss and decide on our future platform.

Please see our [FAQ](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/slack-migration-faq.md), and check the [kubernetes-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/) and the [#announcements channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C9T0QMNG4) for further news. If you have specific feedback on our Slack status join the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/8490).
