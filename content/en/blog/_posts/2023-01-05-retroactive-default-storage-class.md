title: "Kubernetes v1.26: Retroactive Default StorageClass"
date: 2023-01-05
slug: retroactive-default-storage-class
---

**Author:** Roman Bednář (Red Hat)

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default
StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC). With the feature enabled,
you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the
class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.26.

You can read [retroactive default StorageClass assignment](/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#retroactive-default-storageclass-assignment)
in the Kubernetes documentation for more details about how to use that,
or you can read on to learn about why the Kubernetes project is making this change.

## Why did StorageClass assignment need improvements

Users might already be familiar with a similar feature that assigns default StorageClasses
to **new** PVCs at the time of creation. This is currently handled by the
[admission controller](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#defaultstorageclass).

But what if there wasn't a default StorageClass defined at the time of PVC creation? 
Users would end up with a PVC that would never be assigned a class. 
As a result, no storage would be provisioned, and the PVC would be somewhat "stuck" at this point. 
Generally, two main scenarios could result in "stuck" PVCs and cause problems later down the road. 
Let's take a closer look at each of them.

### Changing default StorageClass

With the alpha feature enabled, there were two options admins had when they wanted to change the default StorageClass:

1. Creating a new StorageClass as default before removing the old one associated with the PVC. 
   This would result in having two defaults for a short period.
   At this point, if a user were to create a PersistentVolumeClaim with storageClassName set to
   <code>null</code> (implying default StorageClass), the newest default StorageClass would be
   chosen and assigned to this PVC.

2. Removing the old default first and creating a new default StorageClass.
   This would result in having no default for a short time.
   Subsequently, if a user were to create a PersistentVolumeClaim with storageClassName
   set to <code>null</code> (implying default StorageClass), the PVC would be in
   <code>Pending</code> state forever. The user would have to fix this by deleting
   the PVC and recreating it once the default StorageClass was available.

### Resource ordering during cluster installation

If a cluster installation tool needed to create resources that required storage,
for example, an image registry, it was difficult to get the ordering right.
This is because any Pods that required storage would rely on the presence of
a default StorageClass and would fail to be created if it wasn't defined.

## What changed

We've changed the PersistentVolume (PV) controller to assign a default StorageClass
to any unbound PersistentVolumeClaim that has the storageClassName set to <code>null</code>.
We've also modified the PersistentVolumeClaim admission within the API server to allow
the change of values from an unset value to an actual StorageClass name.

### Null `storageClassName` versus `storageClassName: ""` - does it matter? { #null-vs-empty-string }

Before this feature was introduced, those values were equal in terms of behavior.
Any PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName set to <code>null</code> or <code>""</code>
would bind to an existing PersistentVolume resource with storageClassName also set to
<code>null</code> or <code>""</code>.

With this new feature enabled we wanted to maintain this behavior but also be able to update the StorageClass name.
With these constraints in mind, the feature changes the semantics of <code>null</code>.
If a default StorageClass is present, <code>null</code> would translate to "Give me a default" and
<code>""</code> would mean "Give me PersistentVolume that also has <code>""</code> StorageClass name."
In the absence of a StorageClass, the behavior would remain unchanged.

Summarizing the above, we've changed the semantics of <code>null</code> so that
its behavior depends on the presence or absence of a definition of default StorageClass.

The tables below show all these cases to better describe when PVC binds and when its StorageClass gets updated.

     <tr>
        <th colspan="2"></th>
        <th>PVC <tt>storageClassName</tt> = <code>""</code></th>
        <th>PVC <tt>storageClassName</tt> = <code>null</code></th>
     </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
     <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Without default class</td>
        <td>PV <tt>storageClassName</tt> = <code>""</code></td>
        <td>binds</td>
        <td>binds</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>PV without <tt>storageClassName</tt></td>
        <td>binds</td>
        <td>binds</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">With default class</td>
        <td>PV <tt>storageClassName</tt> = <code>""</code></td>
        <td>binds</td>
        <td>class updates</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>PV without <tt>storageClassName</tt></td>
        <td>binds</td>
        <td>class updates</td>
     </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## How to use it

If you want to test the feature whilst it's alpha, you need to enable the relevant
feature gate in the kube-controller-manager and the kube-apiserver.
Use the `--feature-gates` command line argument:

```
--feature-gates="...,RetroactiveDefaultStorageClass=true"
```

### Test drive

If you would like to see the feature in action and verify it works fine in your cluster here's what you can try:

1. Define a basic PersistentVolumeClaim:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   metadata:
     name: pvc-1
   spec:
     accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 1Gi
   ```

2. Create the PersistentVolumeClaim when there is no default StorageClass.
   The PVC won't provision or bind (unless there is an existing, suitable PV already present)
   and will remain in <code>Pending</code> state.

   ```shell
   kubectl get pvc
   ```

   The output is similar to this:
   ```console
   NAME      STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
   pvc-1     Pending   
   ```

3. Configure one StorageClass as default.

   ```shell
   kubectl patch sc -p '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
   ```

   The output is similar to this:
   ```console
   storageclass.storage.k8s.io/my-storageclass patched
   ```

4. Verify that PersistentVolumeClaims is now provisioned correctly and was updated retroactively with new default StorageClass.

   ```shell
   kubectl get pvc
   ```

   The output is similar to this:
   ```console
   NAME      STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE
   pvc-1     Bound    pvc-06a964ca-f997-4780-8627-b5c3bf5a87d8   1Gi        RWO            my-storageclass   87m
   ```

### New metrics

To help you see that the feature is working as expected we also introduced a new
<code>retroactive_storageclass_total</code> metric to show how many times that the
PV controller attempted to update PersistentVolumeClaim, and
<code>retroactive_storageclass_errors_total</code> to show how many of those attempts failed.
