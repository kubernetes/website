Hello everyone and Happy 2020! It’s hard to believe that KubeCon EU 2020 is less than six weeks away, and with that another contributor summit! This year we have the pleasure of being in Amsterdam in early spring, so be sure to pack some warmer clothing. This summit looks to be exciting with a lot of fantastic community-driven content. We received **26** submissions from the CFP. From that, the events team selected **12** sessions. Each of the sessions falls into one of four categories:

*   Community
*   Contributor Improvement
*   Sustainability
*   In-depth Technical 

On top of the presentations, there will be a dedicated Docs Sprint as well as the New Contributor Workshop 101 and 201 Sessions. All told, we will have five separate rooms of content throughout the day on Monday. Please **[see the full schedule](https://kcseu2020.sched.com/)** to see what sessions you’d be interested in. We hope between the content provided and the inevitable hallway track, everyone has a fun and enriching experience. 

Speaking of fun, the social Sunday night should be a blast! We’re hosting this summit’s social close to the conference center, at [ZuidPool](https://www.zuid-pool.nl/en/). There will be games, bingo, and unconference sign-up throughout the evening. It should be a relaxed way to kick off the week. 

[Registration is open](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubernetes-contributor-summit-europe/)! Space is limited so it’s always a good idea to register early. 

If you have any questions, reach out to the [Amsterdam Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events/2020/03-contributor-summit#team) on Slack in the [#contributor-summit](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C7J893413) channel.

Hope to see you there!
