We'll have talks from Google executives Brian Stevens, VP of Cloud Product, and Eric Brewer, VP of Google Infrastructure. They will share their perspective on where Kubernetes is and where it's going that you won't want to miss.  

Several of our community partners will be there including CoreOS, Redapt, Intel, Mesosphere, Mirantis, the OpenStack Foundation, CloudBees, Kismatic and Bitnami.
