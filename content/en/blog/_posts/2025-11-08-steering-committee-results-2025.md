The [2025 Steering Committee Election](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections/steering/2025) is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2025. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.

The Steering Committee oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee’s role in their [charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering/blob/master/charter.md).

Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community’s continued health and success.
