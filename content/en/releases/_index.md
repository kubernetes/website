<!-- overview -->

The Kubernetes project maintains release branches for the most recent three minor releases ({{< skew latestVersion >}}, {{< skew prevMinorVersion >}}, {{< skew oldestMinorVersion >}}).  Kubernetes 1.19 and newer receive approximately 1 year of patch support. Kubernetes 1.18 and older received approximately 9 months of patch support.

Kubernetes versions are expressed as **x.y.z**,
where **x** is the major version, **y** is the minor version, and **z** is the patch version, following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) terminology.

More information in the [version skew policy](/releases/version-skew-policy/) document.
