Kubernetes has made the Ops experience much easier, but how does the developer experience compare? Ops teams can deploy a Kubernetes cluster in a matter of minutes. But developers need to understand a host of new concepts before beginning to work with Kubernetes. This can be a tedious and manual process, but it doesn’t have to be. In this talk, [Michelle Noorali](https://twitter.com/michellenoorali), co-lead of SIG-Apps, reimagines the Kubernetes developer experience. She shares her top 3 tips for building a successful developer experience including:  

1.  A framework for thinking about cloud native applications
2.  An integrated experience for debugging and fine-tuning cloud native applicationsA way to get a cloud native application out the door quickly
