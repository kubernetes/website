Since launching the [Auto-refreshing Official CVE feed](/docs/reference/issues-security/official-cve-feed/) as an alpha
feature in the 1.25 release, we have made significant improvements and updates. We are excited to announce the release of the
beta version of the feed. This blog post will outline the feedback received, the changes made, and talk about how you can help 
as we prepare to make this a stable feature in a future Kubernetes Release.


## Feedback from end-users

SIG Security received some feedback from end-users:
- The JSON CVE Feed [did not comply](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/36808)
  with the [JSON Feed specification](https://www.jsonfeed.org/) as its name would suggest.
- The feed could also [support RSS](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/77)
  in addition to JSON Feed format.
- Some metadata could be [added](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/72) to indicate the freshness of
  the feed overall, or [specific CVEs](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/63). Another suggestion was 
  to [indicate](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/71) which Prow job recently updated the feed. See 
  more ideas directly on the [the umbrella issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/1).
- The feed Markdown table on the website [should be ordered](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/issues/73)
  from the most recent to the least recently announced CVE.

## Summary of changes

In response, the SIG did a [rework of the script generating the JSON feed](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-security/pull/76)
to comply with the JSON Feed specification from generation and add a
`last_updated` root field to indicate overall freshness. This redesign needed a
[corresponding fix on the Kubernetes website side](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/38579)
for the CVE feed page to continue to work with the new format.

After that, [RSS feed support](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/39513)
could be added transparently so that end-users can consume the feed in their
preferred format.

Overall, the redesign based on the JSON Feed specification, which this time broke
backward compatibility, will allow updates in the future to address the rest of
the issue while being more transparent and less disruptive to end-users.
