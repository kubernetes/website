by maintaining multiple identical instances of a pod.

Replicas are commonly used in Kubernetes to achieve the desired application state and reliability.
They enable workload scaling and distribution across multiple nodes in a cluster.

By defining the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, Kubernetes ensures that
the specified number of instances are running, automatically adjusting the count as needed.

Replica management allows for efficient load balancing, rolling updates, and
self-healing capabilities in a Kubernetes cluster.
