<!-- overview -->

This section of the Kubernetes documentation contains pages that
show how to do individual tasks. A task page shows how to do a
single thing, typically by giving a short sequence of steps.

If you would like to write a task page, see
[Creating a Documentation Pull Request](/docs/contribute/new-content/open-a-pr/).
