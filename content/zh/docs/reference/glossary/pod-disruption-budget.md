 Pod Disruption Budget 是这样一种对象：它保证在主动中断（ voluntary disruptions）时，多实例应用的 {{< glossary_tooltip text="Pod" term_id="pod" >}} 不会少于一定的数量。

<!--
 A [Pod Disruption Budget](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) allows an application owner to create an object for a replicated application, that ensures a certain number or percentage of Pods with an assigned label will not be voluntarily evicted at any point in time. PDBs cannot prevent an involuntary disruption, but will count against the budget.
-->
 [Pod Disruption Budget](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/) 使应用所有者能够为多实例应用创建一个对象，来确保一定数量的具有指定标签的 Pod 在任何时候都不会被主动驱逐。 PDB 无法防止非主动的中断，但是会计入预算（budget）。
