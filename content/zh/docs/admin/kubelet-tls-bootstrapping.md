title: TLS bootstrapping

{{< toc >}}

## Overview

This document describes how to set up TLS client certificate bootstrapping for kubelets.
Kubernetes 1.4 introduced an API for requesting certificates from a cluster-level Certificate Authority (CA). The original intent of this API is to enable provisioning of TLS client certificates for kubelets. The proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/20439)
and progress on the feature is being tracked as [feature #43](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/43).

## kube-apiserver configuration

The API server should be configured with an [authenticator](/docs/admin/authentication/) that can authenticate tokens as a user in the `system:bootstrappers` group.

This group will later be used in the controller-manager configuration to scope approvals in the default approval
controller. As this feature matures, you should ensure tokens are bound to a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policy which limits requests
(using the bootstrap token) strictly to client requests related to certificate provisioning. With RBAC in place, scoping the tokens to a group allows for great flexibility (e.g. you could disable a particular bootstrap group's access when you are done provisioning the nodes).

While any authentication strategy can be used for the kubelet's initial bootstrap credentials, the following two authenticators are recommended for ease of provisioning.

1. [Bootstrap Tokens](/docs/admin/bootstrap-tokens/) - __alpha__
2. [Token authentication file](###token-authentication-file)

Using bootstrap tokens is currently __alpha__ and will simplify the management of bootstrap token management especially in a HA scenario. 

### Token authentication file
Tokens are arbitrary but should represent at least 128 bits of entropy derived from a secure random number
generator (such as /dev/urandom on most modern systems). There are multiple ways you can generate a token. For example:

`head -c 16 /dev/urandom | od -An -t x | tr -d ' '`

will generate tokens that look like `02b50b05283e98dd0fd71db496ef01e8`

The token file should look like the following example, where the first three values can be anything and the quoted group
name should be as depicted:

```
02b50b05283e98dd0fd71db496ef01e8,kubelet-bootstrap,10001,"system:bootstrappers"
```

Add the `--token-auth-file=FILENAME` flag to the kube-apiserver command (in your systemd unit file perhaps) to enable the token file.
See docs [here](/docs/admin/authentication/#static-token-file) for further details.

### Client certificate CA bundle

Add the `--client-ca-file=FILENAME` flag to the kube-apiserver command to enable client certificate authentication,
referencing a certificate authority bundle containing the signing certificate (e.g. `--client-ca-file=/var/lib/kubernetes/ca.pem`).

## kube-controller-manager configuration
The API for requesting certificates adds a certificate-issuing control loop to the Kubernetes Controller Manager. This takes the form of a
[cfssl](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cfssl/) local signer using assets on disk. Currently, all certificates issued have one year validity and a default set of key usages.

### Signing assets
You must provide a Certificate Authority in order to provide the cryptographic materials necessary to issue certificates.
This CA should be trusted by kube-apiserver for authentication with the `--client-ca-file=FILENAME` flag. The management
of the CA is beyond the scope of this document but it is recommended that you generate a dedicated CA for Kubernetes.
Both certificate and key are assumed to be PEM-encoded.

The kube-controller-manager flags are:

```
--cluster-signing-cert-file="/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.crt" --cluster-signing-key-file="/etc/path/to/kubernetes/ca/ca.key"
```

### Approval controller

In 1.7 the experimental "group auto approver" controller is dropped in favor of the new `csrapproving` controller
that ships as part of [kube-controller-manager](/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/) and is enabled by default.
The controller uses the [`SubjectAccessReview` API](/docs/admin/authorization/#checking-api-access) to determine
if a given user is authorized to request a CSR, then approves based on the authorization outcome. To prevent
conflicts with other approvers, the builtin approver doesn't explicitly deny CSRs, only ignoring unauthorized requests.

The controller categorizes CSRs into three subresources:

1. `nodeclient` - a request by a user for a client certificate with `O=system:nodes` and `CN=system:node:(node name)`.
2. `selfnodeclient` - a node renewing a client certificate with the same `O` and `CN`.
3. `selfnodeserver` - a node renewing a serving certificate. (ALPHA, requires feature gate)

The checks to determine if a CSR is a `selfnodeserver` request is currently tied to the kubelet's credential rotation
implementation, an __alpha__ feature. As such, the definition of `selfnodeserver` will likely change in a future and
requires the `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` feature gate on the controller manager. The feature progress can be
tracked at [kubernetes/features#267](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/267).

```
--feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true
```

The following RBAC `ClusterRoles` represent the `nodeclient`, `selfnodeclient`, and `selfnodeserver` capabilities. Similar roles
may be automatically created in future releases.

```yml
# A ClusterRole which instructs the CSR approver to approve a user requesting
# node client credentials.
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: approve-node-client-csr
rules:
- apiGroups: ["certificates.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["certificatesigningrequests/nodeclient"]
  verbs: ["create"]
---
# A ClusterRole which instructs the CSR approver to approve a node renewing its
# own client credentials.
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: approve-node-client-renewal-csr
rules:
- apiGroups: ["certificates.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["certificatesigningrequests/selfnodeclient"]
  verbs: ["create"]
---
# A ClusterRole which instructs the CSR approver to approve a node requesting a
# serving cert matching its client cert.
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: approve-node-server-renewal-csr
rules:
- apiGroups: ["certificates.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["certificatesigningrequests/selfnodeserver"]
  verbs: ["create"]
```

These powers can be granted to credentials, such as bootstrapping tokens. For example, to replicate the behavior
provided by the removed auto-approval flag, of approving all CSRs by a single group:

```
# REMOVED: This flag no longer works as of 1.7.
--insecure-experimental-approve-all-kubelet-csrs-for-group="system:bootstrappers"
```

An admin would create a `ClusterRoleBinding` targeting that group.

```yml
# Approve all CSRs for the group "system:bootstrappers"
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: auto-approve-csrs-for-group
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: system:bootstrappers
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: approve-node-client-csr
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

To let a node renew its own credentials, an admin can construct a `ClusterRoleBinding` targeting
that node's credentials:

```yml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: node1-client-cert-renewal
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: system:node:node-1 # Let "node-1" renew its client certificate.
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: approve-node-client-renewal-csr
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Deleting the binding will prevent the node from renewing its client credentials, effectively
removing it from the cluster once its certificate expires.

## kubelet configuration
To request a client certificate from kube-apiserver, the kubelet first needs a path to a kubeconfig file that contains the
bootstrap authentication token. You can use `kubectl config set-cluster`, `set-credentials`, and `set-context` to build this kubeconfig. Provide the name `kubelet-bootstrap` to `kubectl config set-credentials` and include `--token=<token-value>` as follows:

```
kubectl config set-credentials kubelet-bootstrap --token=${BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN} --kubeconfig=bootstrap.kubeconfig
```

When starting the kubelet, if the file specified by `--kubeconfig` does not exist, the bootstrap kubeconfig is used to request a client certificate from the API server. On approval of the certificate request and receipt back by the kubelet, a kubeconfig file referencing the generated key and obtained certificate is written to the path specified by `--kubeconfig`. The certificate and key file will be placed in the directory specified by `--cert-dir`.

**Note:** The following flags are required to enable this bootstrapping when starting the kubelet:

```
--bootstrap-kubeconfig="/path/to/bootstrap/kubeconfig"
```

Additionally, in 1.7 the kubelet implements __alpha__ features for enabling rotation of both its client and/or serving certs.
These can be enabled through the respective `RotateKubeletClientCertificate` and `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` feature
flags on the kubelet, but may change in backward incompatible ways in future releases.

```
--feature-gates=RotateKubeletClientCertificate=true,RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true
```

`RotateKubeletClientCertificate` causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing
credentials expire. `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after
bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate. The serving cert currently does not request DNS or IP
SANs.

## kubectl approval
The signing controller does not immediately sign all certificate requests. Instead, it waits until they have been flagged with an
"Approved" status by an appropriately-privileged user. This is intended to eventually be an automated process handled by an external
approval controller, but for the alpha version of the API it can be done manually by a cluster administrator using kubectl.
An administrator can list CSRs with `kubectl get csr` and describe one in detail with `kubectl describe csr <name>`. Before the 1.6 release there were
[no direct approve/deny commands](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/30163) so an approver had to update
the Status field directly ([rough how-to](https://github.com/gtank/csrctl)). Later versions of Kubernetes offer `kubectl certificate approve <name>` and `kubectl certificate deny <name>` commands.
