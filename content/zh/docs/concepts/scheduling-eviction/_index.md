  在Kubernetes中，调度 (scheduling) 指的是确保 Pods 匹配到合适的节点，
  以便 kubelet 能够运行它们。抢占 (Preemption) 指的是终止低优先级的 Pods 以便高优先级的 Pods 可以
  调度运行的过程。驱逐 (Eviction) 是在资源匮乏的节点上，主动让一个或多个 Pods 失效的过程。

  In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes
  so that the kubelet can run them. Preemption is the process of terminating
  Pods with lower Priority so that Pods with higher Priority can schedule on
  Nodes. Eviction is the process of proactively terminating one or more Pods on
  resource-starved Nodes.
