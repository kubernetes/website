您好，欢迎回到 KubeCon 首次发言人的第二部分和最后部分。如果您错过了上一篇文章，请阅读[此处](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/10/18/tips-for-your-first-kubecon-presentation---part-1/)。

## The Day before the Show
-->

## 会议前一天

<!--
**Tip #13 - Get enough sleep**. I don't know about you, but when I don't get enough sleep (especially when beer is in the game), the next day my brain power is around 80% at best. It's very easy to get distracted at KubeCon (in a positive sense). "Let's have dinner tonight and chat about XYZ". Get some food, beer or wine because you're so excited and all the good resolutions you had set for the day before your presentation are forgotten :) 
-->

**建议 #13 - 获得充足的睡眠**。我不了解你，但是当我没有得到足够的睡眠时（尤其是游戏中的喝了啤酒），第二天我的脑力最多只有80％左右。 在 KubeCon 上很容易分心（从积极的意义上讲）。 “今晚我们共进晚餐，聊聊 XYZ”。 得到一些食物，啤酒或葡萄酒，因为你很兴奋，你在演讲前一天所设定的所有好的解决方案都被遗忘了:) 

<!--
OK, I'm slightly exaggerating here. But don't underestimate the dynamics of this conference, the amazing people you meet, the inspiring talks and of course the conference party. Be disciplined, at least that one day. There's enough time to party after your great presentation!
-->

好的，我在这里有点夸张。 但是，不要低估这次会议的动态，你遇到的令人惊叹的人，鼓舞人心的会谈，当然还有会议派对。 在会议之前，至少有一天要纪律严明。在精彩的演讲之后，有足够的时间参加派对！

<!--
**Tip #14 - A final dry-run**. Usually, I do a final dry-run of my presentation the day before the talk. This helps me to recall the first few sentences I want to say so I keep the flow no matter what happens when the red recording light goes on. Especially when your talk is later during the conference, there's so much new stuff your brain has to digest which could "overwrite" the very important parts of your presentation. I think you know what I mean. So, if you're like me, a final dry-run is never a bad idea (also to check equipment, demos, etc.).
-->

**建议 #14 - 最后的演讲**。通常，我会在演讲前一天做最后的演讲。 这有助于我回忆起我想说的前几句话，所以无论红色记录灯亮起时发生什么，我都会保持固定的语速。 特别是当你在会议期间的谈话时，你的大脑有很多新的东西需要消化，这可能会“覆盖”演示文稿中非常重要的部分。 我想你知道我的意思。所以，如果你像我一样，最后的演讲绝不是一个坏主意（也可以检查设备，演示等）。

<!--
**Tip #15 - Promote your session, again**. Send out a final reminder on your social media channels so your followers (and KubeCon attendees) will recall to attend your session (again, KubeCon is busy and it's hard to keep up with all the talks you wanted to attend). I was surprised to see my attendee list jumping from ~80 at the beginning of the week to >300 the day before the talk. The number kept rising even an hour before going on stage. So don't worry about the stats too early.
-->

**建议 #15 - 再次发送演讲通知**。 在您的社交媒体渠道发送最终提醒，以便您的关注者（和 KubeCon 与会者）将记得参加您的会议（再次， KubeCon 很忙，很难跟上您想参加的所有会谈）。 我很惊讶地看到我的与会者名单从本周开始时的~80增加到谈话前一天的 >300。 在上台前一小时，这个数字一直在上升。 因此，不要过早担心统计数据。

<!--
**Tip #16 - Ask your idols to attend**. [Steve Wong](https://twitter.com/cantbewong), a colleague of mine who I really admire for his knowledge and passion, gave me a great advise. Reach out to the people you always wanted to attend your talk and kindly ask them to come along. 
-->

**建议 #16 - 请你的偶像参加**。 [Steve Wong](https://twitter.com/cantbewong),我的一位同事，我非常钦佩他的知识和热情，给了我一个很好的建议。 联系你一直想参加你的演讲的人，请他们一起来。

<!--
So I texted the one and only [Tim Hockin](https://twitter.com/thockin?lang=de). Even though these well-respected community leaders are super busy and thus usually cannot attend many talks during the conference, the worst thing that can happen is that they cannot show up and will let you know. (see the end of this post to find out whether or not I was lucky :))
-->

所以我发短信给了 [Tim Hockin]，尽管这些备受尊敬的社区领导人非常忙碌，因此在会议期间通常无法参加很多会谈，但最糟糕的事情是他们无法出现并会让你知道。 （看这篇文章的结尾，看看我是否幸运:)）

<!--
## The show is on!
-->

## 会议开始了!

<!--
Your day has come and it doesn't make **any** sense to make big changes to your presentation now! Actually, that's a very bad idea unless you're an expert and your heartbeat at rest is around 40 BPM. (But even then many things can go horribly wrong). 
-->

你的演讲时刻到了，现在对你的演讲做出重大改变并没有任何意义！ 实际上，这是一个非常糟糕的想法，除非你是一名专家，你的心跳静止在40 BPM 左右。（但即便如此，很多事情都可能出错）。

<!--
So, without further ado, here are my final tips for you. 
-->

所以，不用多说了，这是我的最后一些建议。

<!--
**Tip #17 - Arrive ahead of time**. Set an alert (or two) to not miss your presentation, e.g. because somebody caught you on the way to the room or you got a call/have been pulled in a meeting. It's a good idea to find out were your room is at least some hours before your talk. These conference buildings can be very large. Also look for last minute schedule (time/room) changes, just because you never know...
-->

**建议 #17 - 提前到达会场**。设置一个闹铃（或两个），以免错过您的演讲，例如 因为有人在前往房间的途中遇到了你，或者你有一个电话/已被拉入会议。 最好在你演讲前几个小时弄清楚你的房间在哪里。 这些会议楼可能非常大。 还要查看最后一刻的时间表（时间/房间）变化，因为你永远不知道......

<!--
**Tip #18 - Ask a friend to take photos**. My dear colleague [Bjoern](https://twitter.com/bbrundert), without me asking for it, took a lot of pictures and watched the audience during the talk. This was really helpful, not just because I now have some nice shots that will always remind me of this great day. He also gave me honest feedback, e.g. what people said, whether they liked it or what I could have done better. 
-->

**建议 #18 - 叫一个朋友帮忙拍照**。我并没有要求我亲爱的同事[比约恩]，但他却帮我拍了很多照片，在演讲过程中观察者观众。这真的很有帮助，不仅仅是因为我现在有一些漂亮的照片，而且将永远提醒我这伟大的一天。他也给了我诚实的反馈，比如人们说了什么，他们是否喜欢，或者我本可以做得更好。

<!--
**Tip #19 - Restroom**. If you're like me, when I'm nervous I could run every 15 minutes. The last thing you want is that you are fully cabled (microphone), everything is set up and two minutes before your presentation you feel like "oh oh"...nothing more to say here ;)
-->

**建议 #19 -休息室**。如果你像我一样，当我紧张时，我可以每15分钟跑一次休息室。 你要的做的最后一件事就是你的耳麦是好的（麦克风），一切都准备就绪，你的演讲前两分钟你觉得“哦哦”......这里没什么好说的;）

<!--
**Tip #20 - The audience**. I had many examples and references from other Kubernetes users (and their postmortem stories) in my talk. So I tried to give them credit and actually some of them were in the room and really liked that I did so. It gave them (and hopefully the rest of the audience as well) the feeling that I did not invent the wheel and we are all in the same boat. Also feel free to ask some questions in the beginning, e.g. to get a better feeling about who is attending your talk, or who would consider himself an expert in the area of what you are talking about, etc.
-->

**建议 #20 - 观众**。在我的演讲中，我有很多来自其他 Kubernetes 用户的例子和参考资料（以及他们的事后故事）。 因此，我尽量给予他们信任，实际上他们中的一些人在房间里，并且真的很喜欢我这样做。 它给了他们（并且希望其他观众也是这样）一种感觉，我没有发明轮子而且我们都在同一条船上。 当然也可以在开始时提出一些问题，例如： 更好地了解谁在参加你的演讲，或者谁会认为自己是你所谈论的领域的专家，等等。

<!--
**Tip #21 - Repeat questions. Always**. Because of the time constraints, questions should be asked at the end of your presentation (unless you are giving a community meeting or panel of course). Always (always!) repeat the questions at the end. Sometimes people will not use the microphone. This is not only hard for the people in the back, but also it won't be captured on the recording. I am sure you also had that moment watching a recording and not getting what is being asked/discussed because the question was not captured.
-->

**建议 #21 - 总是在最后重复问题**。由于时间限制，应在演示结束时询问问题（除非您正在举办社区会议或小组讨论）。 总是（总是！）在最后重复问题。 有时人们不会使用麦克风。 这不仅对后面的人很难，而且也不会在录音中被捕获。 我相信你也有那一刻观看录音而没有得到被问及/讨论的内容，因为这个问题没有被捕获。

<!--
**Tip #22 - Feedback**. Don't forget to ask the audience to fill out the survey. They're not always enforced/mandatory during conferences (especially not at KubeCon), so it's easy to forget to give the speaker feedback. Feedback is super critical (also for the committee) as sometimes people won't directly tell you but rather write their thoughts. Also, you might want to block your calendar to leave some time after the presentation for follow-up questions, so you are not in the hurry to catch your next meeting/session.
-->

**建议 #22 - 反馈**。不要忘记要求观众填写调查问卷。 在会议期间（尤其不是在 KubeCon），由于它们并不总是强制/强制执行，因此很容易忘记给予演讲者反馈。 反馈是非常关键的（也适用于委员会），因为有时人们不会直接告诉你，而是写出他们的想法。 此外，您可能需要延后您的行程，在演讲后留出一些时间用于跟进问题，因此您不必急于赶上下一次会议/会议。

<!--
**Tip #23 - Invite your audience**. No, I don't mean to throw a round of beer for everyone attending your talk (I mean, you could). But you might let them know, at the end of your presentation, that you would like to hang out, have dinner, etc. A great opportunity to reflect and geek out with like-minded friends.
-->

**建议 #23 - 邀请您的观众**。不，我不是说为参加你演讲的每个人扔一轮啤酒（我的意思是，你可以）。 但是你可以在演讲结束时让他们知道你想要出去玩，吃晚饭等等。这是一个和志同道合的朋友一起反思和极客的好机会。

<!--
**Final Tip - Your Voice matters**. Don't underestimate the power of giving a talk at a conference. In my case I was lucky that the Zalando crew was in the room and took this talk as an opportunity for an ad hoc meeting after the conference. This drove an important performance fix forward, which eventually was [merged](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63437) (kudos to the Zalando team again!). 
-->

**最后的建议 - 你的声音很重要**。 不要低估在会议上演讲的力量。就我而言，我很幸运， Zalando 的工作人员当时就在会议室里，并把这次演讲作为会后召开 ad hoc 会议的机会。这推动了一个重要的性能修正，最终被[合并](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/63437) (再次向 Zalando 团队致敬!)

<!--
Embrace the opportunity to give a talk at a conference, take it serious, be professional and make the best use of your time. But I'm sure I don't have to tell you that ;)
-->

抓住在会议上演讲的机会，认真对待，专业一点，充分利用你的时间。但我相信我不必告诉你这些;)

<!--
## Now it's on you :)
-->

## 现在轮到你了：）

<!--
I hope some of these tips are useful for you as well. And I wish you all the best for your upcoming talk!!! Believing in and being yourself is key to success. And perhaps your Kubernetes idol is in the room and has some nice words for you after your presentation!
-->

我希望这些建议对你也有用。我希望你在接下来的演讲中一切顺利!!!相信并做自己是成功的关键。也许你的 Kubernetes 偶像就在房间里，在你的演讲结束后，他会对你说一些赞扬的话!

<!--
Besides my fantastic reviewers and the speaker support team already mentioned above, I also would like to thank the people who supported me along this KubeCon journey: Bjoern, Timo, Emad and Steve!
-->
除了我前面提到的出色的评论家和演讲者支持团队，我还要感谢那些在 KubeCon 之旅中支持我的人：Bjoern，Timo，Emad 和 Steve！
