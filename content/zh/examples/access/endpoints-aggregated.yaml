      Add endpoints write permissions to the edit and admin roles. This was
      removed by default in 1.22 because of CVE-2021-25740. See
      https://issue.k8s.io/103675. This can allow writers to direct LoadBalancer
      or Ingress implementations to expose backend IPs that would not otherwise
      be accessible, and can circumvent network policies or security controls
      intended to prevent/isolate access to those backends.
