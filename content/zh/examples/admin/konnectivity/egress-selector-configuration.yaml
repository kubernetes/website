  connection:
    # This controls the protocol between the API Server and the Konnectivity
    # server. Supported values are "GRPC" and "HTTPConnect". There is no
    # end user visible difference between the two modes. You need to set the
    # Konnectivity server to work in the same mode.

    transport:
      # This controls what transport the API Server uses to communicate with the
      # Konnectivity server. UDS is recommended if the Konnectivity server
      # locates on the same machine as the API Server. You need to configure the
      # Konnectivity server to listen on the same UDS socket.
      # The other supported transport is "tcp". You will need to set up TLS 
      # config to secure the TCP transport.
