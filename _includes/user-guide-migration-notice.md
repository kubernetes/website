  <p><b>NOTICE</b></p>
  <p>As of March 14, 2017, the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-maintainers">@kubernetes/sig-docs-maintainers</a> have begun migration of the User Guide content as announced previously to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs">SIG Docs community</a> through the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs">kubernetes-sig-docs</a> group and <a href="https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs/">kubernetes.slack.com #sig-docs</a> channel.</p>
  <p>The user guides within this section are being refactored into topics within Tutorials, Tasks, and Concepts. Anything that has been moved will have a notice placed in its previous location as well as a link to its new location. The reorganization implements the table of contents (ToC) outlined in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/18hRCIorVarExB2eBVHTUR6eEJ2VVk5xq1iBmkQv8O6I/edit?usp=sharing">kubernetes-docs-toc</a> document and should improve the documentation's findability and readability for a wider range of audiences.</p>
  <p>For any questions, please contact: <a href="mailto:kubernetes-sig-docs@googlegroups.com">kubernetes-sig-docs@googlegroups.com</a></p>
