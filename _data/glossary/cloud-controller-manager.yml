short-description: >
  Cloud Controller Manager is an alpha feature in 1.8. In upcoming releases it will be the preferred way to integrate Kubernetes with any cloud.
long-description: >
  Kubernetes v1.6 contains a new binary called cloud-controller-manager. cloud-controller-manager is a daemon that embeds cloud-specific control loops. 
  These cloud-specific control loops were originally in the kube-controller-manager. Since cloud providers develop and release at a different pace compared to the Kubernetes 
  project, abstracting the provider-specific code to the cloud-controller-manager binary allows cloud vendors to evolve independently from the core Kubernetes code.
