  Members within a SIG have a shared interest in advancing a specific area, such as architecture, API machinery, or documentation.
  SIGs must follow the [SIG Governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-governance.md) guidelines but can have their own contribution policy and channels of communication.

  For more information, see the [kubernetes/community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) repo and the current list of [SIGs and Working Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md).
