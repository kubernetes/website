  * In the **Kubernetes Community**: Conversations often use *upstream* to mean the core Kubernetes codebase, which the general ecosystem, other code, or third-party tools relies upon. For example, [community members](#term-member) may suggest that a feature is moved upstream so that it is in the core codebase instead of in a plugin or third-party tool.
  * In **GitHub** or **git**: The convention is to refer to a source repo as *upstream*, whereas the forked repo is considered *downstream*.
