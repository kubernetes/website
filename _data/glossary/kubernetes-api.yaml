short-description: >
  The application that serves Kubernetes functionality through a RESTful interface and stores the state of the cluster.
long-description: >
  Kubernetes resources and "records of intent" are all stored as API objects, and modified via RESTful calls to the API.
  The API allows configuration to be managed in a declarative way.
  Users can interact with the Kubernetes API directly, or via tools like `kubectl`.
  The core Kubernetes API is flexible and can also be extended to support custom resources.
