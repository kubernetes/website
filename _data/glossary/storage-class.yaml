short-description: >
  A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe different available storage types.
long-description: >
  StorageClasses can map to quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by cluster administrators.
  Each StorageClass contains the fields `provisioner`, `parameters`, and `reclaimPolicy`, which are used when a {% glossary_tooltip text="Persistent Volume" term_id="persistent-volume" %} belonging to the class needs to be dynamically provisioned. Users can request a particular class using the name of a StorageClass object.
