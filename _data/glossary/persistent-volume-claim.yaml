short-description: >
  A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is used to claim storage resources defined in a PersistentVolume (PV) so that it can be mounted as a volume in a container.
long-description: |
  The PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) specifies the amount of storage, how the storage will be accessed (read-only, read-write and/or exclusive) and how it is reclaimed (retained, recycled or deleted), but no details of the storage itself (which are in the PV).
