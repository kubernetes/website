short-description: |
  Manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, *and provide guarantees about ordering*. They do so by maintaining a *unique*, sticky identity for each of their Pods.

long-description: |
  Like Deployments, StatefulSets manage Pods that are based on an identical container spec. However, although their specs are the same, the Pods in a StatefulSet are not interchangeable. Each Pod has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

  StatefulSets also operate according to the Controller pattern. You define your desired state in a StatefulSet *object*, and the StatefulSet *controller* makes any necessary updates to the get there from the current state.
