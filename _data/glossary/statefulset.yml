short-description: |
  Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of [Pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod), *and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness* of these Pods.

long-description: |
  Like a [Deployment](/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment), a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable&#58; each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

  A StatefulSet operates under the same pattern as any other Controller. You define your desired state in a StatefulSet *object*, and the StatefulSet *controller* makes any necessary updates to get there from the current state.
