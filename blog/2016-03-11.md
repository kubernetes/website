### ElasticBox introduces ElasticKube to help manage Kubernetes within the enterprise 
Today’s guest post is brought to you by Brannan Matherson, from ElasticBox, who’ll discuss a new open source project to help standardize container deployment and management in enterprise environments. This highlights the advantages of authentication and user management for containerized applications

I’m delighted to share some exciting work that we’re doing at ElasticBox to contribute to the open source community regarding the rapidly changing advancements in container technologies. Our team is kicking off a new initiative called [ElasticKube](http://elastickube.com/) to help solve the problem of challenging container management scenarios within the enterprise. This project is a native container management experience that is specific to Kubernetes and leverages automation to provision clusters for containerized applications based on the latest release of Kubernetes 1.2. &nbsp;

I’ve talked to many enterprise companies, both large and small, and the plethora of cloud offering capabilities is often confusing and makes the evaluation process very difficult, so why Kubernetes? Of the large public cloud players - Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform - Kubernetes is poised to take an innovative leadership role in framing the container management space. The Kubernetes platform does not restrict or dictate any given technical approach for containers, but encourages the community to collectively solve problems as this container market still takes form. &nbsp;With a proven track record of supporting open source efforts, Kubernetes platform allows my team and me to actively contribute to this fundamental shift in the IT and developer world.

We’ve chosen Kubernetes, not just for the core infrastructure services, but also the agility of Kubernetes to leverage the cluster management layer across any cloud environment - GCP, AWS, Azure, vSphere, and Rackspace. Kubernetes also provides a huge benefit for users to run clusters for containers locally on many popular technologies such as: Docker, Vagrant (and VirtualBox), CoreOS, Mesos and more. &nbsp;This amount of choice enables our team and many others in the community to consider solutions that will be viable for a wide range of enterprise scenarios. In the case of ElasticKube, we’re pleased with Kubernetes 1.2 which includes the full release of the deployment API. This provides the ability for us to perform seamless rolling updates of containerized applications that are running in production. In addition, we’ve been able to support new resource types like ConfigMaps and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers.

Fundamentally, ElasticKube delivers a web console for which compliments Kubernetes for users managing their clusters. The initial experience incorporates team collaboration, lifecycle management and reporting, so organizations can efficiently manage resources in a predictable manner. Users will see an ElasticKube portal that takes advantage of the infrastructure abstraction that enables users to run a container that has already been built. With ElasticKube assuming the cluster has been deployed, the overwhelming value is to provide visibility into who did what and define permissions for access to the cluster with multiple containers running on them. Secondly, by partitioning clusters into namespaces, authorization management is more effective. Finally, by empowering users to build a set of reusable templates in a modern portal, ElasticKube provides a vehicle for delivering a self-service template catalog that can be stored in GitHub (for instance, using Helm templates) and deployed easily.

ElasticKube enables organizations to accelerate adoption by developers, application operations and traditional IT operations teams and shares a mutual goal of increasing developer productivity, driving efficiency in container management and promoting the use of microservices as a modern application delivery methodology. When leveraging ElasticKube in your environment, users need to ensure the following technologies are configured appropriately to guarantee everything runs correctly:

- 
Configure Google Container Engine (GKE) for cluster installation and management 

- 
Use Kubernetes to provision the infrastructure and clusters for containers &nbsp;

- 
Use your existing tools of choice to actually build your containers
- 

Use ElasticKube to run, deploy and manage your containers and services

“Kubernetes has provided us the level of sophistication required for enterprises to manage containers across complex networking environments and the appropriate amount of visibility into the application lifecycle. &nbsp;Additionally, the community commitment and engagement has been exceptional, and we look forward to being a major contributor to this next wave of modern cloud computing and application management.” &nbsp;

erentiate between two types of operations:

- 
Platform-oriented, relates to the overall infrastructure, often including various systems, one of which might be Kubernetes.
- 
Application-oriented, focusses rather on a single, or a small set of applications deployed on Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is already great for the application-oriented part. Cloud Load Control was created to help platform-oriented operators to efficiently manage Kubernetes as part of the overall infrastructure and make it easy to execute Kubernetes tasks relevant to them.

The first version of Cloud Load Control provides a user interface integrated in the OpenStack Horizon dashboard which enables the Platform ops to create and manage their Kubernetes clusters.

Clusters are treated as first-class citizens of OpenStack. Their creation is as simple as the creation of a virtual machine. Operators do not need to learn a new system or method of provisioning, and the self-service approach enables large organizations to rapidly provide the Kubernetes infrastructure to their tenants.

An intuitive UI is crucial for the simplification of operations. This is why we heavily contributed to the[Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) project and ship it in Cloud Load Control. Especially for operators who don’t know the Kubernetes CLI by heart, because they have to care about other systems too, a great UI is perfectly suitable to get typical operational tasks done, such as checking the health of the system or deploying a new application.

Monitoring is essential. With the dashboard, it is possible to get insights on cluster level. To ensure that the OpenStack operators have a deep understanding of their platform, we will soon add an integration with[Monasca](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Monasca), OpenStack’s monitoring-as-a-service project, so metrics of Kubernetes can be analyzed together with OpenStack metrics from a single point of access.
**Quality and enterprise-grade support**  

As a Japanese company, quality and customer focus have the highest priority in every product and service we ship. This is where the actual value of Cloud Cloud Control comes from: it provides a specific version of the open source software which has been intensively tested and hardened to ensure stable operations on a particular set of platforms.

Acknowledging that container technology and Kubernetes is new territory for a lot of enterprises, expert assistance is the key for setting up and running a production-grade container infrastructure. Cloud Load Control comes with a support service leveraging Fujitsu’s proven support structure. This enables support also for customers operating Kubernetes in different regions of the world, like Europe and Japan, as part of the same offering.
**Conclusion**  

2014 seems to be light years away, we believe the decision for Kubernetes was the right one. It is built from the ground-up to enable the creation of container-based, distributed applications, and best supports this use case.

With Cloud Load Control, we’re excited to enable enterprises to run Kubernetes in production environments and to help their operators to efficiently use it, so DevOps teams can build awesome applications on top of it.
