# <strong>GETTING STARTED</strong>

This section contains the most basic commands for getting a workload
running on your cluster.

- `run` will start running 1 or more instances of a container image on your cluster.
- `expose` will load balance traffic across the running instances, and can create a HA proxy for accessing the containers from outside the cluster.

Once your workloads are running, you can use the commands in the
[WORKING WITH APPS](#-strong-working-with-apps-strong-) section to
inspect them.
