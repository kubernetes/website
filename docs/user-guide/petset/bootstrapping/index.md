* Starting in Kubernetes version 1.5, PetSet has been renamed to [StatefulSet](/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets). To use (or continue to use) PetSet in Kubernetes 1.5, you _must_ migrate your exsiting PetSets to StatefulSets. For information on working with StatefulSet, see the tutorial on [how to run replicated stateful applications](/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/run-replicated-stateful-application).

* __This document has been deprecated__, but can still apply if you're using Kubernetes version 1.4 or earlier.
