The Kubernetes **Guides** can help you work with various aspects of the Kubernetes system.

* The Kubernetes [User Guide](#user-guide-internal) can help you run programs and services on an existing Kubernetes cluster.
* The [Cluster Admin Guide](/docs/admin/) can help you set up and administrate your own Kubernetes cluster.
* The [Developer Guide] can help you either write code to directly access the Kubernetes API, or to contribute directly to the Kubernetes project.

## <a name="user-guide-internal"></a>Kubernetes User Guide

The following topics in the Kubernetes User Guide can help you run applications and services on a Kubernetes cluster:

1. [Quick start: launch and expose an application](/docs/user-guide/quick-start/)
1. [Configuring and launching containers: configuring common container parameters](/docs/user-guide/configuring-containers/)
1. [Deploying continuously running applications](/docs/user-guide/deploying-applications/)
1. [Connecting applications: exposing applications to clients and users](/docs/user-guide/connecting-applications/)
1. [Working with containers in production](/docs/user-guide/production-pods/)
1. [Managing deployments](/docs/user-guide/managing-deployments/)
1. [Application introspection and debugging](/docs/user-guide/introspection-and-debugging/)
    1. [Using the Kubernetes web user interface](/docs/user-guide/ui/)
    1. [Logging](/docs/user-guide/logging/overview/)
    1. [Monitoring](/docs/user-guide/monitoring/)
    1. [Getting into containers via `exec`](/docs/user-guide/getting-into-containers/)
    1. [Connecting to containers via proxies](/docs/user-guide/connecting-to-applications-proxy/)
    1. [Connecting to containers via port forwarding](/docs/user-guide/connecting-to-applications-port-forward/)

Before running examples in the user guides, please ensure you have completed the [prerequisites](/docs/user-guide/prereqs/).

## Kubernetes Concepts

[**Cluster**](/docs/admin/)
: A cluster is a set of physical or virtual machines and other infrastructure resources used by Kubernetes to run your applications.

[**Node**](/docs/admin/node/)
: A node is a physical or virtual machine running Kubernetes, onto which pods can be scheduled.

[**Pod**](/docs/user-guide/pods/)
: A pod is a co-located group of containers and volumes.

[**Label**](/docs/user-guide/labels/)
: A label is a key/value pair that is attached to a resource, such as a pod, to convey a user-defined identifying attribute. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of resources.

[**Selector**](/docs/user-guide/labels/#label-selectors)
: A selector is an expression that matches labels in order to identify related resources, such as which pods are targeted by a load-balanced service.

[**Replication Controller**](/docs/user-guide/replication-controller/)
: A replication controller ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. It both allows for easy scaling of replicated systems and handles re-creation of a pod when the machine it is on reboots or otherwise fails.

[**Service**](/docs/user-guide/services/)
: A service defines a set of pods and a means by which to access them, such as single stable IP address and corresponding DNS name.

[**Volume**](/docs/user-guide/volumes/)
: A volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to a Container as part of its filesystem.  Kubernetes volumes build upon [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/), adding provisioning of the volume directory and/or device.

[**Secret**](/docs/user-guide/secrets/)
: A secret stores sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, which can be made available to containers upon request.

[**Name**](/docs/user-guide/identifiers/)
: A user- or client-provided name for a resource.

[**Namespace**](/docs/user-guide/namespaces/)
: A namespace is like a prefix to the name of a resource. Namespaces help different projects, teams, or customers to share a cluster, such as by preventing name collisions between unrelated teams.

[**Annotation**](/docs/user-guide/annotations/)
: A key/value pair that can hold larger (compared to a label), and possibly not human-readable, data, intended to store non-identifying auxiliary data, especially data manipulated by tools and system extensions.  Efficient filtering by annotation values is not supported.
