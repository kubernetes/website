This section of the Kubernetes documentation contains tutorials.
A tutorial shows how to accomplish a goal that is larger than a single
[task](/docs/tasks/). Typically a tutorial has several sections,
each of which has a sequence of steps.

* [Kubernetes Basics](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) is an in-depth interactive tutorial that helps you understand the Kubernetes system and try out some basic Kubernetes features.
