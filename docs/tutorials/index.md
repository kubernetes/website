This section of the Kubernetes documentation contains tutorials.
A tutorial shows how to accomplish a goal that is larger than a single
[task](/docs/tasks/). Typically a tutorial has several sections,
each of which has a sequence of steps.

#### Kubernetes Basics

#### Stateless Applications

* [Running a Stateless Application Using a Deployment](/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/)

* [Using a Service to Access an Application in a Cluster](/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address-service/)

* [Exposing an External IP Address to Access an Application in a Cluster](/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/)
