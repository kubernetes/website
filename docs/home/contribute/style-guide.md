## Documentation formatting standards

### Use camel case for API objects

When you refer to an API object, use the same uppercase and lowercase letters
that are used in the actual object name. Typically, the names of API
objects use
[camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

Don't split the API object name into separate words. For example, use
PodTemplateList, not Pod Template List.

Refer to API objects without saying "object," unless omitting "object"
leads to an awkward construction.

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>The Pod has two Containers.</td><td>The pod has two containers.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The Deployment is responsible for ...</td><td>The Deployment object is responsible for ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A PodList is a list of Pods.</td><td>A Pod List is a list of pods.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The two ContainerPorts ...</td><td>The two ContainerPort objects ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The two ContainerStateTerminated objects ...</td><td>The two ContainerStateTerminateds ...</td></tr>
</table>

### Use angle brackets for placeholders

Use angle brackets for placeholders. Tell the reader what a placeholder
represents.

1. Display information about a pod:

        kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

    where `<pod-name>` is the name of one of your pods.

### Use bold for user interface elements

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Click <b>Fork</b>.</td><td>Click "Fork".</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Select <b>Other</b>.</td><td>Select 'Other'.</td></tr>
</table>

### Use italics to define or introduce new terms

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>A <i>cluster</i> is a set of nodes ...</td><td>A "cluster" is a set of nodes ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>These components form the <i>control plane.</i></td><td>These components form the <b>control plane.</b></td></tr>
</table>

### Use code style for filenames, directories, and paths

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Open the <code>envars.yaml</code> file.</td><td>Open the envars.yaml file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Go to the <code>/docs/tutorials</code> directory.</td><td>Go to the /docs/tutorials directory.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Open the <code>/_data/concepts.yaml</code> file.</td><td>Open the /_data/concepts.yaml file.</td></tr>
</table>

## Inline code formatting

### Use code style for inline code and commands

For inline code in an HTML document, use the `<code>` tag. In a Markdown
document, use the backtick (`).

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>The <code>kubectl run</code> command creates a Deployment.</td><td>The "kubectl run" command creates a Deployment.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>For declarative management, use <code>kubectl apply</code>.</td><td>For declarative management, use "kubectl apply".</td></tr>
</table>

### Use code style for object field names

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Set the value of the <code>replicas</code> field in the configuration file.</td><td>Set the value of the "replicas" field in the configuration file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The value of the <code>exec</code> field is an ExecAction object.</td><td>The value of the "exec" field is an ExecAction object.</td></tr>
</table>

### Use normal style for string and integer field values

For field values of type string or integer, use normal style without quotation marks.

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Set the value of <code>imagePullPolicy</code> to Always.</td><td>Set the value of <code>imagePullPolicy</code> to "Always".</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Set the value of <code>image</code> to nginx:1.8.</td><td>Set the value of <code>image</code> to <code>nginx:1.8</code>.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Set the value of the <code>replicas</code> field to 2.</td><td>Set the value of the <code>replicas</code> field to <code>2</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

## Code snippet formatting

### Don't include the command prompt

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>kubectl get pods</td><td>$ kubectl get pods</td></tr>
</table>

### Separate commands from output

Verify that the pod is running on your chosen node:

    kubectl get pods --output=wide

The output is similar to this:

    NAME     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP           NODE
    nginx    1/1       Running   0          13s    10.200.0.4   worker0


{% comment %}## Kubernetes.io word list

A list of Kubernetes-specific terms and words to be used consistently across the site.

<table>
  <tr><th>Term</th><th>Useage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>TBD</td><td>TBD</td></tr>
</table>{% endcomment %}


## Content best practices

This section contains suggested best practices for clear, concise, and consistent content.

### Use present tense

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>This command starts a proxy.</td><td>This command will start a proxy.</td></tr>
</table>

Exception: Use future or past tense if it is required to convey the correct
meaning.

### Use active voice

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>You can explore the API using a browser.</td><td>The API can be explored using a browser.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>The YAML file specifies the replica count.</td><td>The replica count is specified in the YAML file.</td></tr>
</table>

Exception: Use passive voice if active voice leads to an awkward construction.

### Use simple and direct language

Use simple and direct language. Avoid using unnecessary phrases, such as saying "please."

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>To create a ReplicaSet, ...</td><td>In order to create a ReplicaSet, ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>See the configuration file.</td><td>Please see the configuration file.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>View the Pods.</td><td>With this next command, we'll view the Pods.</td></tr>

</table>

### Address the reader as "you"

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>You can create a Deployment by ...</td><td>We'll create a Deployment by ...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>In the preceding output, you can see...</td><td>In the preceding output, we can see ...</td></tr>
</table>

## Patterns to avoid

### Avoid using "we"

Using "we" in a sentence can be confusing, because the reader might not know
whether they're part of the "we" you're describing.

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Version 1.4 includes ...</td><td>In version 1.4, we have added ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Kubernetes provides a new feature for ...</td><td>We provide a new feature ...</td></tr>
  <tr><td>This page teaches you how to use pods.</td><td>In this page, we are going to learn about pods.</td></tr>
</table>

### Avoid jargon and idioms

Some readers speak English as a second language. Avoid jargon and idioms to help make their understanding easier.

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Internally, ...</td><td>Under the hood, ...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Create a new cluster.</td><td>Turn up a new cluster.</td></tr>
</table>

### Avoid statements about the future

Avoid making promises or giving hints about the future. If you need to talk about
an alpha feature, put the text under a heading that identifies it as alpha
information.

### Avoid statements that will soon be out of date

Avoid words like "currently" and "new." A feature that is new today might not be
considered new in a few months.

<table>
  <tr><th>Do</th><th>Don't</th></tr>
  <tr><td>In version 1.4, ...</td><td>In the current version, ...</td></tr>
    <tr><td>The Federation feature provides ...</td><td>The new Federation feature provides ...</td></tr>
</table>
