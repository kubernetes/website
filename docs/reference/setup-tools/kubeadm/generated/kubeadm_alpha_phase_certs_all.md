Generates all PKI assets necessary to establish the control plane

### Synopsis

Generates a self-signed CA to provision identities for each component in the cluster (including nodes) and client certificates to be used by various components. 

If a given certificate and private key pair both exist, kubeadm skips the generation step and
existing files will be used. 

Alpha Disclaimer: this command is currently alpha.

```
kubeadm alpha phase certs all [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Creates all PKI assets necessary to establish the control plane,
  # functionally equivalent to what generated by kubeadm init.
  kubeadm alpha phase certs all
  
  # Creates all PKI assets using options read from a configuration file.
  kubeadm alpha phase certs all --config masterconfiguration.yaml
```
