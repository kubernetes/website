# <strong>CONFIG & STORAGE</strong>

Config and Storage resources are responsible for injecting data into your applications and persisting data externally to your container.

Common resource types:

- [ConfigMaps](#configmap-v1) for providing text key value pairs injected into the application through environment variables, command line arguments, or files
- [Secrets](#secret-v1) for providing binary data injected into the application through files
- [Volumes](#volume-v1) for providing a filesystem external to the Container.  Maybe shared across Containers within the same Pod and have a lifetime persisting beyond a Container or Pod.
