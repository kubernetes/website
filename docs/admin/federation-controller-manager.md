## federation-controller-manager



### Synopsis


The federation controller manager is a daemon that embeds
the core control loops shipped with federation. In applications of robotics and
automation, a control loop is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of
the system. In federation, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared
state of the federation cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting
to move the current state towards the desired state. Examples of controllers that
ship with federation today is the cluster controller.

### Options

```
      --address=0.0.0.0: The IP address to serve on (set to 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
      --cluster-monitor-period=40s: The period for syncing ClusterStatus in ClusterController.
      --concurrent-service-syncs=10: The number of service syncing operations that will be done concurrently. Larger number = faster endpoint updating, but more CPU (and network) load
      --dns-provider="": DNS provider. Valid values are: ["aws-route53" "google-clouddns"]
      --dns-provider-config="": Path to config file for configuring DNS provider.
      --federated-api-burst=30: Burst to use while talking with federation apiserver
      --federated-api-qps=20: QPS to use while talking with federation apiserver
      --federation-name="": Federation name.
      --kube-api-content-type="": ContentType of requests sent to apiserver. Passing application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf is an experimental feature now.
      --kubeconfig="": Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information.
      --leader-elect[=false]: Start a leader election client and gain leadership before executing the main loop. Enable this when running replicated components for high availability.
      --leader-elect-lease-duration=15s: The duration that non-leader candidates will wait after observing a leadership renewal until attempting to acquire leadership of a led but unrenewed leader slot. This is effectively the maximum duration that a leader can be stopped before it is replaced by another candidate. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --leader-elect-renew-deadline=10s: The interval between attempts by the acting master to renew a leadership slot before it stops leading. This must be less than or equal to the lease duration. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --leader-elect-retry-period=2s: The duration the clients should wait between attempting acquisition and renewal of a leadership. This is only applicable if leader election is enabled.
      --log-flush-frequency=5s: Maximum number of seconds between log flushes
      --master="": The address of the federation API server (overrides any value in kubeconfig)
      --port=10253: The port that the controller-manager's http service runs on
      --profiling[=true]: Enable profiling via web interface host:port/debug/pprof/
      --zone-name="": Zone name, like example.com.
