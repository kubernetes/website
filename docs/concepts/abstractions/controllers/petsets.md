title: PetSets
---

__Warning:__ Starting in Kubernetes version 1.5, PetSet has been renamed to [StatefulSet](/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets). To use (or continue to use) PetSet in Kubernetes 1.5, you _must_ [migrate](/docs/tasks/manage-stateful-set/upgrade-pet-set-to-stateful-set/) your existing PetSets to StatefulSets. For information on working with StatefulSet, see the tutorial on [how to run replicated stateful applications](/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/run-replicated-stateful-application).

__This document has been deprecated__.
