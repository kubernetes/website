title: Cluster Networking
---

Kubernetes approaches networking somewhat differently than Docker does by
default.  There are 4 distinct networking problems to solve:

1. Highly-coupled container-to-container communications: this is solved by
   [pods](/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) and `localhost` communications.
2. Pod-to-Pod communications: this is the primary focus of this document.
3. Pod-to-Service communications: this is covered by [services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).
4. External-to-Service communications: this is covered by [services](/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

## Summary

Kubernetes assumes that pods can communicate with other pods, regardless of
which host they land on.  We give every pod its own IP address so you do not
need to explicitly create links between pods and you almost never need to deal
with mapping container ports to host ports.  This creates a clean,
backwards-compatible model where pods can be treated much like VMs or physical
hosts from the perspectives of port allocation, naming, service discovery, load
balancing, application configuration, and migration.

To achieve this we must impose some requirements on how you set up your cluster
networking.

## Docker model

Before discussing the Kubernetes approach to networking, it is worthwhile to
review the "normal" way that networking works with Docker.  By default, Docker
uses host-private networking.  It creates a virtual bridge, called `docker0` by
default, and allocates a subnet from one of the private address blocks defined
in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) for that bridge.  For each
container that Docker creates, it allocates a virtual ethernet device (called
`veth`) which is attached to the bridge. The veth is mapped to appear as `eth0`
in the container, using Linux namespaces.  The in-container `eth0` interface is
given an IP address from the bridge's address range.

The result is that Docker containers can talk to other containers only if they
are on the same machine (and thus the same virtual bridge).  Containers on
different machines can not reach each other - in fact they may end up with the
exact same network ranges and IP addresses.

In order for Docker containers to communicate across nodes, they must be
allocated ports on the machine's own IP address, which are then forwarded or
proxied to the containers.  This obviously means that containers must either
coordinate which ports they use very carefully or else be allocated ports
dynamically.

## Kubernetes model

Coordinating ports across multiple developers is very difficult to do at
scale and exposes users to cluster-level issues outside of their control.
Dynamic port allocation brings a lot of complications to the system - every
application has to take ports as flags, the API servers have to know how to
insert dynamic port numbers into configuration blocks, services have to know
how to find each other, etc.  Rather than deal with this, Kubernetes takes a
different approach.

Kubernetes imposes the following fundamental requirements on any networking
implementation (barring any intentional network segmentation policies):

   * all containers can communicate with all other containers without NAT
   * all nodes can communicate with all containers (and vice-versa) without NAT
   * the IP that a container sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as

What this means in practice is that you can not just take two computers
running Docker and expect Kubernetes to work.  You must ensure that the
fundamental requirements are met.

This model is not only less complex overall, but it is principally compatible
with the desire for Kubernetes to enable low-friction porting of apps from VMs
to containers.  If your job previously ran in a VM, your VM had an IP and could
talk to other VMs in your project.  This is the same basic model.

Until now this document has talked about containers.  In reality, Kubernetes
applies IP addresses at the `Pod` scope - containers within a `Pod` share their
network namespaces - including their IP address.  This means that containers
within a `Pod` can all reach each other's ports on `localhost`. This does imply
that containers within a `Pod` must coordinate port usage, but this is no
different than processes in a VM.  We call this the "IP-per-pod" model.  This
is implemented in Docker as a "pod container" which holds the network namespace
open while "app containers" (the things the user specified) join that namespace
with Docker's `--net=container:<id>` function.

As with Docker, it is possible to request host ports, but this is reduced to a
very niche operation.  In this case a port will be allocated on the host `Node`
and traffic will be forwarded to the `Pod`.  The `Pod` itself is blind to the
existence or non-existence of host ports.

## How to achieve this

There are a number of ways that this network model can be implemented.  This
document is not an exhaustive study of the various methods, but hopefully serves
as an introduction to various technologies and serves as a jumping-off point.

The following networking options are sorted alphabetically - the order does not
imply any preferential status.

### Cilium

[Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) is open source software for
providing and transparently securing network connectivity between application
containers. Cilium is L7/HTTP aware and can enforce network policies on L3-L7
using an identity based security model that is decoupled from network
addressing.

### Contiv

[Contiv](https://github.com/contiv/netplugin) provides configurable networking (native l3 using BGP, overlay using vxlan,  classic l2, or Cisco-SDN/ACI) for various use cases. [Contiv](http://contiv.io) is all open sourced.

### Contrail

[Contrail](http://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/sdn/contrail/contrail-networking/), based on [OpenContrail](http://www.opencontrail.org), is a truly open, multi-cloud network virtualization and policy management platform. Contrail / OpenContrail is integrated with various orchestration systems such as Kubernetes, OpenShift, OpenStack and Mesos, and provides different isolation modes for virtual machines, containers/pods and bare metal workloads.

### Flannel

[Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel) is a very simple overlay
network that satisfies the Kubernetes requirements. Many
people have reported success with Flannel and Kubernetes.

### Google Compute Engine (GCE)

For the Google Compute Engine cluster configuration scripts, we use [advanced
routing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#routing) to
assign each VM a subnet (default is `/24` - 254 IPs).  Any traffic bound for that
subnet will be routed directly to the VM by the GCE network fabric.  This is in
addition to the "main" IP address assigned to the VM, which is NAT'ed for
outbound internet access.  A linux bridge (called `cbr0`) is configured to exist
on that subnet, and is passed to docker's `--bridge` flag.

We start Docker with:

```shell
DOCKER_OPTS="--bridge=cbr0 --iptables=false --ip-masq=false"
```

This bridge is created by Kubelet (controlled by the `--network-plugin=kubenet`
flag) according to the `Node`'s `spec.podCIDR`.

Docker will now allocate IPs from the `cbr-cidr` block.  Containers can reach
each other and `Nodes` over the `cbr0` bridge.  Those IPs are all routable
within the GCE project network.

GCE itself does not know anything about these IPs, though, so it will not NAT
them for outbound internet traffic.  To achieve that we use an iptables rule to
masquerade (aka SNAT - to make it seem as if packets came from the `Node`
itself) traffic that is bound for IPs outside the GCE project network
(10.0.0.0/8).

```shell
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING ! -d 10.0.0.0/8 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```

Lastly we enable IP forwarding in the kernel (so the kernel will process
packets for bridged containers):

```shell
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

The result of all this is that all `Pods` can reach each other and can egress
traffic to the internet.

### L2 networks and linux bridging

If you have a "dumb" L2 network, such as a simple switch in a "bare-metal"
environment, you should be able to do something similar to the above GCE setup.
Note that these instructions have only been tried very casually - it seems to
work, but has not been thoroughly tested.  If you use this technique and
perfect the process, please let us know.

### Nuage Networks VCS (Virtualized Cloud Services)

[Nuage](http://www.nuagenetworks.net) provides a highly scalable policy-based Software-Defined Networking (SDN) platform. Nuage uses the open source Open vSwitch for the data plane along with a feature rich SDN Controller built on open standards.

The Nuage platform uses overlays to provide seamless policy-based networking between Kubernetes Pods and non-Kubernetes environments (VMs and bare metal servers). Nuage's policy abstraction model is designed with applications in mind and makes it easy to declare fine-grained policies for applications.The platform's real-time analytics engine enables visibility and security monitoring for Kubernetes applications.

### OpenVSwitch

[OpenVSwitch](/docs/admin/ovs-networking) is a somewhat more mature but also
complicated way to build an overlay network.  This is endorsed by several of the
"Big Shops" for networking.

### OVN (Open Virtual Networking)

OVN is an opensource network virtualization solution developed by the
Open vSwitch community.  It lets one create logical switches, logical routers,
stateful ACLs, load-balancers etc to build different virtual networking
topologies.  The project has a specific Kubernetes plugin and documentation
at [ovn-kubernetes](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovn-kubernetes).

### Project Calico

[Project Calico](http://docs.projectcalico.org/) is an open source container networking provider and network policy engine.

Calico provides a highly scalable networking and network policy solution for connecting Kubernetes pods based on the same IP networking principles as the internet.  Calico can be deployed without encapsulation or overlays to provide high-performance, high-scale data center networking.  Calico also provides fine-grained, intent based network security policy for Kubernetes pods via its distributed firewall.

Calico can also be run in policy enforcement mode in conjunction with other networking solutions such as Flannel, aka [canal](https://github.com/tigera/canal), or native GCE networking.

### Romana

[Romana](http://romana.io) is an open source network and security automation solution that lets you deploy Kubernetes without an overlay network. Romana supports Kubernetes [Network Policy](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) to provide isolation across network namespaces.

### Weave Net from Weaveworks

[Weave Net](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net/) is a
resilient and simple to use network for Kubernetes and its hosted applications.
Weave Net runs as a [CNI plug-in](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/cni-plugin/)
or stand-alone.  In either version, it doesn't require any configuration or extra code
to run, and in both cases, the network provides one IP address per pod - as is standard for Kubernetes.

### CNI-Genie from Huawei

[CNI-Genie](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie) is a CNI plugin that enables Kubernetes to [simultanously have access to different implementations](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/multiple-cni-plugins/README.md#what-cni-genie-feature-1-multiple-cni-plugins-enables) of the [Kubernetes network model](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes.github.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking.md#kubernetes-model) in runtime. This includes any implementation that runs as a [CNI plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni#3rd-party-plugins), such as [Flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel), [Calico](http://docs.projectcalico.org/), [Romana](http://romana.io), [Weave-net](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-net/).

CNI-Genie also supports [assigning multiple IP addresses to a pod](https://github.com/Huawei-PaaS/CNI-Genie/blob/master/docs/multiple-ips/README.md#feature-2-extension-cni-genie-multiple-ip-addresses-per-pod), each from a different CNI plugin.
