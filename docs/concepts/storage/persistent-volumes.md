## Introduction

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute. The `PersistentVolume` subsystem provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.  To do this we introduce two new API resources:  `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

A `PersistentVolume` (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator.  It is a resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource.   PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV.  This API object captures the details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

A `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) is a request for storage by a user.  It is similar to a pod.  Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources.  Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory).  Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).

While `PersistentVolumeClaims` allow a user to consume abstract storage
resources, it is common that users need `PersistentVolumes` with varying
properties, such as performance, for different problems. Cluster administrators
need to be able to offer a variety of `PersistentVolumes` that differ in more
ways than just size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of
how those volumes are implemented. For these needs there is the `StorageClass`
resource.

A `StorageClass` provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of
storage they offer. Different classes might map to quality-of-service levels,
or to backup policies, or to arbitrary policies determined by the cluster
administrators. Kubernetes itself is unopinionated about what classes
represent. This concept is sometimes called "profiles" in other storage
systems.

Please see the [detailed walkthrough with working examples](/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/walkthrough/).


## Lifecycle of a volume and claim

PVs are resources in the cluster.  PVCs are requests for those resources and also act as claim checks to the resource.  The interaction between PVs and PVCs follows this lifecycle:

### Provisioning

There are two ways PVs may be provisioned: statically or dynamically.

#### Static
A cluster administrator creates a number of PVs. They carry the details of the real storage which is available for use by cluster users.  They exist in the Kubernetes API and are available for consumption.

#### Dynamic
When none of the static PVs the administrator created matches a user's `PersistentVolumeClaim`, the cluster may try to dynamically provision a volume specially for the PVC. This provisioning is based on `StorageClasses`: the PVC must request a class and the administrator must have created and configured that class in order for dynamic provisioning to occur. Claims that request the class `""` effectively disable dynamic provisioning for themselves.

### Binding

A user creates, or has already created in the case of dynamic provisioning, a `PersistentVolumeClaim` with a specific amount of storage requested and with certain access modes.  A control loop in the master watches for new PVCs, finds a matching PV (if possible), and binds them together.  If a PV was dynamically provisioned for a new PVC, the loop will always bind that PV to the PVC. Otherwise, the user will always get at least what they asked for, but the volume may be in excess of what was requested.  Once bound, `PersistentVolumeClaim` binds are exclusive, regardless of the mode used to bind them.

Claims will remain unbound indefinitely if a matching volume does not exist.  Claims will be bound as matching volumes become available.  For example, a cluster provisioned with many 50Gi PVs would not match a PVC requesting 100Gi.  The PVC can be bound when a 100Gi PV is added to the cluster.

### Using

Pods use claims as volumes. The cluster inspects the claim to find the bound volume and mounts that volume for a pod.  For volumes which support multiple access modes, the user specifies which mode desired when using their claim as a volume in a pod.

Once a user has a claim and that claim is bound, the bound PV belongs to the user for as long as they need it. Users schedule Pods and access their claimed PVs by including a persistentVolumeClaim in their Pod's volumes block. [See below for syntax details](#claims-as-volumes).

### Reclaiming

When a user is done with their volume, they can delete the PVC objects from the API which allows reclamation of the resource. The reclaim policy for a `PersistentVolume` tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it has been released of its claim. Currently, volumes can either be Retained, Recycled or Deleted.

#### Retaining

The Retain reclaim policy allows for manual reclamation of the resource. When the `PersistentVolumeClaim` is deleted, the `PersistentVolume` still exists and the volume is considered "released". But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume. An administrator can manually reclaim the volume with the following steps.

1. Delete the `PersistentVolume`. The associated storage asset in external infrastructure (such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume) still exists after the PV is deleted.
1. Manually clean up the data on the associated storage asset accordingly.
1. Manually delete the associated storage asset, or if you want to reuse the same storage asset, create a new `PersistentVolume` with the storage asset definition.

#### Recycling

If supported by appropriate volume plugin, recycling performs a basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`) on the volume and makes it available again for a new claim.

However, an administrator can configure a custom recycler pod template using the Kubernetes controller manager command line arguments as described [here](/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/). The custom recycler pod template must contain a `volumes` specification, as shown in the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pv-recycler
  namespace: default
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
  - name: vol
    hostPath:
      path: /any/path/it/will/be/replaced
  containers:
  - name: pv-recycler
    image: "gcr.io/google_containers/busybox"
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "test -e /scrub && rm -rf /scrub/..?* /scrub/.[!.]* /scrub/*  && test -z \"$(ls -A /scrub)\" || exit 1"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: vol
      mountPath: /scrub
```

However, the particular path specified in the custom recycler pod template in the `volumes` part is replaced with the particular path of the volume that is being recycled.

#### Deleting

For volume plugins that support the Delete reclaim policy, deletion removes both the `PersistentVolume` object from Kubernetes, as well as deleting the associated storage asset in the external infrastructure, such as an AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume. Volumes that were dynamically provisioned are always deleted. If that is not desired, currently, the only option is to edit or patch the PV after it is created. See [Change the Reclaim Policy of a PersistentVolume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-pv-reclaim-policy/).

## Types of Persistent Volumes

`PersistentVolume` types are implemented as plugins.  Kubernetes currently supports the following plugins:

* GCEPersistentDisk
* AWSElasticBlockStore
* AzureFile
* AzureDisk
* FC (Fibre Channel)
* FlexVolume
* Flocker
* NFS
* iSCSI
* RBD (Ceph Block Device)
* CephFS
* Cinder (OpenStack block storage)
* Glusterfs
* VsphereVolume
* Quobyte Volumes
* HostPath (Single node testing only -- local storage is not supported in any way and WILL NOT WORK in a multi-node cluster)
* VMware Photon
* Portworx Volumes
* ScaleIO Volumes
* StorageOS

## Persistent Volumes

Each PV contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the volume.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0003
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  storageClassName: slow
  nfs:
    path: /tmp
    server: 172.17.0.2
```

### Capacity

Generally, a PV will have a specific storage capacity.  This is set using the PV's `capacity` attribute.  See the Kubernetes [Resource Model](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/scheduling/resources.md) to understand the units expected by `capacity`.

Currently, storage size is the only resource that can be set or requested.  Future attributes may include IOPS, throughput, etc.

### Access Modes

A `PersistentVolume` can be mounted on a host in any way supported by the resource provider.  As shown in the table below, providers will have different capabilities and each PV's access modes are set to the specific modes supported by that particular volume.  For example, NFS can support multiple read/write clients, but a specific NFS PV might be exported on the server as read-only.  Each PV gets its own set of access modes describing that specific PV's capabilities.

The access modes are:

* ReadWriteOnce -- the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node
* ReadOnlyMany -- the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes
* ReadWriteMany -- the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

In the CLI, the access modes are abbreviated to:

* RWO - ReadWriteOnce
* ROX - ReadOnlyMany
* RWX - ReadWriteMany

> __Important!__ A volume can only be mounted using one access mode at a time, even if it supports many.  For example, a GCEPersistentDisk can be mounted as ReadWriteOnce by a single node or ReadOnlyMany by many nodes, but not at the same time.

| StorageOS            | &#x2713;     | -           | -            |

### Class

A PV can have a class, which is specified by setting the
`storageClassName` attribute to the name of a
`StorageClass`. A PV of a particular class can only be bound to PVCs requesting
that class. A PV with no `storageClassName` has no class and can only be bound
to PVCs that request no particular class.

In the past, the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` was used instead
of the `storageClassName` attribute. This annotation is still working, however
it will become fully deprecated in a future Kubernetes release.

### Reclaim Policy

Current reclaim policies are:

* Retain -- manual reclamation
* Recycle -- basic scrub (`rm -rf /thevolume/*`)
* Delete -- associated storage asset such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or OpenStack Cinder volume is deleted

Currently, only NFS and HostPath support recycling. AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, and Cinder volumes support deletion.

### Phase

A volume will be in one of the following phases:

* Available -- a free resource that is not yet bound to a claim
* Bound -- the volume is bound to a claim
* Released -- the claim has been deleted, but the resource is not yet reclaimed by the cluster
* Failed -- the volume has failed its automatic reclamation

The CLI will show the name of the PVC bound to the PV.

### Mount Options

A Kubernetes administrator can specify additional mount options for when a Persistent Volume is being mounted on a node.

You can specify a mount option by using the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options` on
your Persistent Volume.

For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: gce-disk-1
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/mount-options: "discard"
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "10Gi"
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  gcePersistentDisk:
    fsType: "ext4"
    pdName: "gce-disk-1"
```

A mount option is a string which will be cumulatively joined and used while mounting volume to the disk.

Note that not all Persistent volume types support mount options. In Kubernetes version 1.6, the following
volume types support mount options.

* GCEPersistentDisk
* AWSElasticBlockStore
* AzureFile
* AzureDisk
* NFS
* iSCSI
* RBD (Ceph Block Device)
* CephFS
* Cinder (OpenStack block storage)
* Glusterfs
* VsphereVolume
* Quobyte Volumes
* VMware Photon


## PersistentVolumeClaims

Each PVC contains a spec and status, which is the specification and status of the claim.

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 8Gi
  storageClassName: slow
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      release: "stable"
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: environment, operator: In, values: [dev]}
```

### Access Modes

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific access modes.

### Resources

Claims, like pods, can request specific quantities of a resource.  In this case, the request is for storage.  The same [resource model](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/scheduling/resources.md) applies to both volumes and claims.

### Selector

Claims can specify a [label selector](/docs/user-guide/labels/#label-selectors) to further filter the set of volumes. Only the volumes whose labels match the selector can be bound to the claim. The selector can consist of two fields:

* matchLabels - the volume must have a label with this value
* matchExpressions - a list of requirements made by specifying key, list of values, and operator that relates the key and values. Valid operators include In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist.

All of the requirements, from both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions` are ANDed together – they must all be satisfied in order to match.

### Class

A claim can request a particular class by specifying the name of a
`StorageClass` using the attribute `storageClassName`.
Only PVs of the requested class, ones with the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can
be bound to the PVC.

PVCs don't necessarily have to request a class. A PVC with its `storageClassName` set
equal to `""` is always interpreted to be requesting a PV with no class, so it
can only be bound to PVs with no class (no annotation or one set equal to
`""`). A PVC with no `storageClassName` is not quite the same and is treated differently
by the cluster depending on whether the
[`DefaultStorageClass` admission plugin](/docs/admin/admission-controllers/#defaultstorageclass)
is turned on.

* If the admission plugin is turned on, the administrator may specify a
default `StorageClass`. All PVCs that have no `storageClassName` can be bound only to
PVs of that default. Specifying a default `StorageClass` is done by setting the
annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` equal to "true" in
a `StorageClass` object. If the administrator does not specify a default, the
cluster responds to PVC creation as if the admission plugin were turned off. If
more than one default is specified, the admission plugin forbids the creation of
all PVCs.
* If the admission plugin is turned off, there is no notion of a default
`StorageClass`. All PVCs that have no `storageClassName` can be bound only to PVs that
have no class. In this case, the PVCs that have no `storageClassName` are treated the
same way as PVCs that have their `storageClassName` set to `""`.

Depending on installation method, a default StorageClass may be deployed
to Kubernetes cluster by addon manager during installation.

When a PVC specifies a `selector` in addition to requesting a `StorageClass`,
the requirements are ANDed together: only a PV of the requested class and with
the requested labels may be bound to the PVC. Note that currently, a PVC with a
non-empty `selector` can't have a PV dynamically provisioned for it.

In the past, the annotation `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` was used instead
of `storageClassName` attribute. This annotation is still working, however
it won't be supported in a future Kubernetes release.

## Claims As Volumes

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume.  Claims must exist in the same namespace as the pod using the claim.  The cluster finds the claim in the pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing the claim.  The volume is then mounted to the host and into the pod.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: dockerfile/nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: mypd
  volumes:
    - name: mypd
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: myclaim
```

### A Note on Namespaces

`PersistentVolumes` binds are exclusive, and since `PersistentVolumeClaims` are namespaced objects, mounting claims with "Many" modes (`ROX`, `RWX`) is only possible within one namespace.

## StorageClasses

Each `StorageClass` contains the fields `provisioner` and `parameters`, which
are used when a `PersistentVolume` belonging to the class needs to be
dynamically provisioned.

The name of a `StorageClass` object is significant, and is how users can
request a particular class. Administrators set the name and other parameters
of a class when first creating `StorageClass` objects, and the objects cannot
be updated once they are created.

Administrators can specify a default `StorageClass` just for PVCs that don't
request any particular class to bind to: see the
[`PersistentVolumeClaim` section](#persistentvolumeclaims)
for details.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
```

### Provisioner
Storage classes have a provisioner that determines what volume plugin is used
for provisioning PVs. This field must be specified.

You are not restricted to specifying the "internal" provisioners
listed here (whose names are prefixed with "kubernetes.io" and shipped
alongside Kubernetes). You can also run and specify external provisioners,
which are independent programs that follow a [specification](https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/design-proposals/storage/volume-provisioning.md)
defined by Kubernetes. Authors of external provisioners have full discretion
over where their code lives, how the provisioner is shipped, how it needs to be
run, what volume plugin it uses (including Flex), etc. The repository [kubernetes-incubator/external-storage](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage)
houses a library for writing external provisioners that implements the bulk of
the specification plus various community-maintained external provisioners.

For example, NFS doesn't provide an internal provisioner, but an external provisioner
can be used. Some external provisioners are listed under the repository [kubernetes-incubator/external-storage](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage).
There are also cases when 3rd party storage vendors provide their own external
provisioner.

### Reclaim Policy
Persistent Volumes that are dynamically created by a storage class will have a reclaim
policy of `delete`.  If that is not desired, the only current option is to edit the
PV after it is created.

Persistent Volumes that are created manually and managed via a storage class will have
whatever reclaim policy they were assigned at creation.

### Parameters
Storage classes have parameters that describe volumes belonging to the storage
class. Different parameters may be accepted depending on the `provisioner`. For
 example, the value `io1`, for the parameter `type`, and the parameter
`iopsPerGB` are specific to EBS. When a parameter is omitted, some default is
used.

#### AWS

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: io1
  zones: us-east-1d, us-east-1c
  iopsPerGB: "10"
```

* `type`: `io1`, `gp2`, `sc1`, `st1`. See [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) for details. Default: `gp2`.
* `zone`: AWS zone. If neither `zone` nor `zones` is specified, volumes are generally round-robin-ed across all active zones where Kubernetes cluster has a node. `zone` and `zones` parameters must not be used at the same time.
* `zones`: A comma separated list of AWS zone(s). If neither `zone` nor `zones` is specified, volumes are generally round-robin-ed across all active zones where Kubernetes cluster has a node. `zone` and `zones` parameters must not be used at the same time.
* `iopsPerGB`: only for `io1` volumes. I/O operations per second per GiB. AWS volume plugin multiplies this with size of requested volume to compute IOPS of the volume and caps it at 20 000 IOPS (maximum supported by AWS, see [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html). A string is expected here, i.e. `"10"`, not `10`.
* `encrypted`: denotes whether the EBS volume should be encrypted or not. Valid values are `"true"` or `"false"`. A string is expected here, i.e. `"true"`, not `true`.
* `kmsKeyId`: optional. The full Amazon Resource Name of the key to use when encrypting the volume. If none is supplied but `encrypted` is true, a key is generated by AWS. See AWS docs for valid ARN value.

#### GCE

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-standard
  zones: us-central1-a, us-central1-b
```

* `type`: `pd-standard` or `pd-ssd`. Default: `pd-standard`
* `zone`: GCE zone. If neither `zone` nor `zones` is specified, volumes are generally round-robin-ed across all active zones where Kubernetes cluster has a node. `zone` and `zones` parameters must not be used at the same time.
* `zones`: A comma separated list of GCE zone(s). If neither `zone` nor `zones` is specified, volumes are generally round-robin-ed across all active zones where Kubernetes cluster has a node. `zone` and `zones` parameters must not be used at the same time.

#### Glusterfs

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:
  resturl: "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
  clusterid: "630372ccdc720a92c681fb928f27b53f"
  restauthenabled: "true"
  restuser: "admin"
  secretNamespace: "default"
  secretName: "heketi-secret"
  gidMin: "40000"
  gidMax: "50000"
  volumetype: "replicate:3"
```

* `resturl`: Gluster REST service/Heketi service url which provision gluster volumes on demand. The general format should be `IPaddress:Port` and this is a mandatory parameter for GlusterFS dynamic provisioner. If Heketi service is exposed as a routable service in openshift/kubernetes setup, this can have a format similar to
`http://heketi-storage-project.cloudapps.mystorage.com` where the fqdn is a resolvable heketi service url.
* `restauthenabled` : Gluster REST service authentication boolean that enables authentication to the REST server. If this value is 'true', `restuser` and `restuserkey` or `secretNamespace` + `secretName` have to be filled. This option is deprecated, authentication is enabled when any of `restuser`, `restuserkey`, `secretName` or `secretNamespace` is specified.
* `restuser` : Gluster REST service/Heketi user who has access to create volumes in the Gluster Trusted Pool.
* `restuserkey` : Gluster REST service/Heketi user's password which will be used for authentication to the REST server. This parameter is deprecated in favor of `secretNamespace` + `secretName`.
* `secretNamespace`, `secretName` : Identification of Secret instance that contains user password to use when talking to Gluster REST service. These parameters are optional, empty password will be used when both `secretNamespace` and `secretName` are omitted. The provided secret must have type "kubernetes.io/glusterfs", e.g. created in this way:
  ```
  $ kubectl create secret generic heketi-secret --type="kubernetes.io/glusterfs" --from-literal=key='opensesame' --namespace=default
  ```
  Example of a secret can be found in [glusterfs-provisioning-secret.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/persistent-volume-provisioning/glusterfs/glusterfs-secret.yaml).
* `clusterid`: `630372ccdc720a92c681fb928f27b53f` is the ID of the cluster which will be used by Heketi when provisioning the volume. It can also be a list of clusterids, for ex:
  "8452344e2becec931ece4e33c4674e4e,42982310de6c63381718ccfa6d8cf397". This is an optional parameter.
* `gidMin`, `gidMax` : The minimum and maximum value of GID range for the storage class. A unique value (GID) in this range ( gidMin-gidMax ) will be used for dynamically provisioned volumes. These are optional values. If not specified, the volume will be provisioned with a value between 2000-2147483647 which are defaults for gidMin and gidMax respectively.
* `volumetype` : The volume type and its parameters can be configured with this optional value. If the volume type is not mentioned, it's up to the provisioner to decide the volume type.
  For example:
    'Replica volume':
      `volumetype: replicate:3` where '3' is replica count.
    'Disperse/EC volume':
      `volumetype: disperse:4:2` where '4' is data and '2' is the redundancy count.
    'Distribute volume':
      `volumetype: none`

  For available volume types and administration options, refer to the [Administration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Storage/3.1/html/Administration_Guide/part-Overview.html).

  For further reference information, see [How to configure Heketi](https://github.com/heketi/heketi/wiki/Setting-up-the-topology).

  When persistent volumes are dynamically provisioned, the Gluster plugin automatically creates an endpoint and a headless service in the name `gluster-dynamic-<claimname>`. The dynamic endpoint and service are automatically deleted when the persistent volume claim is deleted.

#### OpenStack Cinder

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: gold
provisioner: kubernetes.io/cinder
parameters:
  type: fast
  availability: nova
```

* `type`: [VolumeType](https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/dashboard-manage-volumes.html) created in Cinder. Default is empty.
* `availability`: Availability Zone. If not specified, volumes are generally round-robin-ed across all active zones where Kubernetes cluster has a node.

#### vSphere

1. Create a persistent volume with a user specified disk format.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
  diskformat: zeroedthick
```

-   `diskformat`: `thin`, `zeroedthick` and `eagerzeroedthick`. Default: `"thin"`.

2. Create a persistent volume with a disk format on a user specified datastore.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
    diskformat: zeroedthick
    datastore: VSANDatastore
```

-   `diskformat`: `thin`, `zeroedthick` and `eagerzeroedthick`. Default: `"thin"`.
-   `datastore`: The user can also specify the datastore in the Storageclass. The volume will be created on the datastore specified in the storage class which in this case is `VSANDatastore`. This field is optional. If not specified as in previous YAML description, the volume will be created on the datastore specified in the vsphere config file used to initialize the vSphere Cloud Provider.

3. Create a persistent volume with user specified VSAN storage capabilities.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: vsan-policy-fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume
parameters:
  diskformat: thin
  hostFailuresToTolerate: "1"
  diskStripes: "2"
  cacheReservation: "20"
  datastore: VSANDatastore
```

-   Here, the user can specify VSAN storage capabilities for dynamic volume provisioning inside Kubernetes.
-   Storage Policies capture storage requirements, such as performance and availability, for persistent volumes. These policies determine how the container volume storage objects are provisioned and allocated within the datastore to guarantee the requested Quality of Service. Storage policies are composed of storage capabilities, typically represented by a key-value pair. The key is a specific property that the datastore can offer and the value is a metric, or a range, that the datastore guarantees for a provisioned object, such as a container volume backed by a virtual disk.
-   As described in [official documentation](https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vsphere.virtualsan.doc%2FGUID-08911FD3-2462-4C1C-AE81-0D4DBC8F7990.html), VSAN exposes multiple storage capabilities. The below table lists VSAN storage capabilities that are currently supported by vSphere Cloud Provider.

    Storage Capability Name       | Description
    -------------------- | ------------
    cacheReservation     | Flash read cache reservation
    diskStripes          | Number of disk stripes per object
    forceProvisioning     | Force provisioning
    hostFailuresToTolerate     | Number of failures to tolerate
    iopsLimit     | IOPS limit for object
    objectSpaceReservation     | Object space reservation

    vSphere Infrastructure(VI) administrator can specify storage requirements for applications in terms of storage capabilities while creating a storage class inside Kubernetes. Please note that while creating a StorageClass, administrator should specify storage capability names used in the table above as these names might differ from the ones used by VSAN. For example - Number of disk stripes per object is referred to as stripeWidth in VSAN documentation however vSphere Cloud Provider uses a friendly name diskStripes.

You can see [vSphere example](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/volumes/vsphere) for more details.

#### Azure Disk

##### Azure Unmanaged Disk Storage Class

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
  location: eastus
  storageAccount: azure_storage_account_name
```

* `skuName`: Azure storage account Sku tier. Default is empty.
* `location`: Azure storage account location. Default is empty.
* `storageAccount`: Azure storage account name. If a storage account is provided, it must reside in the same resource group as the cluster, and `location` is ignored. If a storage account is not provided, a new storage account will be created in the same resource group as the cluster.

##### New Azure Disk Storage Class (starting from v1.7.2)

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
parameters:
  storageaccounttype: Standard_LRS
  kind: Shared
```

* `storageaccounttype`: Azure storage account Sku tier. Default is empty.
* `kind`: Possible values are `shared` (default), `dedicated`, and `managed`. When `kind` is `shared`, all unmanaged disks are created in a few shared storage accounts in the same resource group as the cluster. When `kind` is `dedicated`, a new dedicated storage account will be created for the new unmanaged disk in the same resource group as the cluster.

- Premium VM can attach both Standard_LRS and Premium_LRS disks, while Standard VM can only attach Standard_LRS disks.
- Managed VM can only attach managed disks and unmanaged VM can only attach unmanaged disks.

#### Azure File

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: azurefile
provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-file
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
  location: eastus
  storageAccount: azure_storage_account_name
```

* `skuName`: Azure storage account Sku tier. Default is empty.
* `location`: Azure storage account location. Default is empty.
* `storageAccount`: Azure storage account name.  Default is empty. If a storage account is not provided, all storage accounts associated with the resource group are searched to find one that matches `skuName` and `location`. If a storage account is provided, it must reside in the same resource group as the cluster, and `skuName` and `location` are ignored.

During provision, a secret is created for mounting credentials. If the cluster has enabled both [RBAC](/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) and [Controller Roles](/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/#controller-roles), add the `create` permission of resource `secret` for clusterrole `system:controller:persistent-volume-binder`.

#### Portworx Volume

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: portworx-io-priority-high
provisioner: kubernetes.io/portworx-volume
parameters:
  repl: "1"
  snap_interval:   "70"
  io_priority:  "high"

```

*  `fs`: filesystem to be laid out: [none/xfs/ext4] (default: `ext4`).
*  `block_size`: block size in Kbytes (default: `32`).
*  `repl`: number of synchronous replicas to be provided in the form of replication factor [1..3] (default: `1`) A string is expected here i.e.`"1"` and not `1`.
*  `io_priority`: determines whether the volume will be created from higher performance or a lower priority storage [high/medium/low] (default: `low`).
*  `snap_interval`: clock/time interval in minutes for when to trigger snapshots. Snapshots are incremental based on difference with the prior snapshot, 0 disables snaps (default: `0`). A string is expected here i.e. `"70"` and not `70`.
*  `aggregation_level`: specifies the number of chunks the volume would be distributed into, 0 indicates a non-aggregated volume (default: `0`). A string is expected here i.e. `"0"` and not `0`
*  `ephemeral`: specifies whether the volume should be cleaned-up after unmount or should be persistent. `emptyDir` use case can set this value to true and `persistent volumes` use case such as for databases like Cassandra should set to false, [true/false] (default `false`). A string is expected here i.e. `"true"` and not `true`.

#### ScaleIO

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/scaleio
parameters:
  gateway: https://192.168.99.200:443/api
  system: scaleio
  protectionDomain: default
  storagePool: default
  storageMode: ThinProvisionned
  secretRef: sio-secret
  readOnly: false
  fsType: xfs
```

* `provisioner`: attribute is set to `kubernetes.io/scaleio`
* `gateway`: address to a ScaleIO API gateway (required)
* `system`: the name of the ScaleIO system (required)
* `protectionDomain`: the name of the ScaleIO protection domain
* `storagePool`: the name of the volume storage pool
* `storageMode`: the storage provision mode: `ThinProvisionned` (default) or `ThickProvisionned`
* `secretRef`: reference to a configured Secret object (required, see detail below)
* `readOnly`: specifies the access mode to the mounted volume
* `fsType`: the file system to use for the volume

The ScaleIO Kubernetes volume plugin requires a configured Secret object.
The secret must be created with type `kubernetes.io/scaleio` and use the same namespace value as that of the PVC where it is referenced
as shown in the following command:

```
$> kubectl create secret generic sio-secret --type="kubernetes.io/scaleio" --from-literal=username=sioadmin --from-literal=password=d2NABDNjMA== --namespace=default
```

#### StorageOS

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/storageos
parameters:
  pool: default
  description: Kubernetes volume
  fsType: ext4
  adminSecretNamespace: default
  adminSecretName: storageos-secret
```

* `pool`: The name of the StorageOS distributed capacity pool to provision the volume from.  Uses the `default` pool which is normally present if not specified.
* `description`: The description to assign to volumes that were created dynamically.  All volume descriptions will be the same for the storage class, but different storage classes can be used to allow descriptions for different use cases.  Defaults to `Kubernetes volume`.
* `fsType`: The default filesystem type to request.  Note that user-defined rules within StorageOS may override this value.  Defaults to `ext4`.
* `adminSecretNamespace`: The namespace where the API configuration secret is located.  Required if adminSecretName set.
* `adminSecretName`: The name of the secret to use for obtaining the StorageOS API credentials.  If not specified, default values will be attempted.

The StorageOS Kubernetes volume plugin can use a Secret object to specify an endpoint and credentials to access the StorageOS API.  This is only required when the defaults have been changed.
The secret must be created with type `kubernetes.io/storageos` as shown in the following command:

```
$ kubectl create secret generic storageos-secret --type="kubernetes.io/storageos" --from-literal=apiAddress=tcp://localhost:5705 --from-literal=apiUsername=storageos --from-literal=apiPassword=storageos --namespace=default
```

Secrets used for dynamically provisioned volumes may be created in any namespace and referenced with the `adminSecretNamespace` parameter.  Secrets used by pre-provisioned volumes must be created in the same namespace as the PVC that references it.

## Writing Portable Configuration

If you're writing configuration templates or examples that run on a wide range of clusters
and need persistent storage, we recommend that you use the following pattern:

- Do include PersistentVolumeClaim objects in your bundle of config (alongside Deployments, ConfigMaps, etc).
- Do not include PersistentVolume objects in the config, since the user instantiating the config may not have
  permission to create PersistentVolumes.
- Give the user the option of providing a storage class name when instantiating the template.
  - If the user provides a storage class name, and the cluster is version 1.4 or newer, put that value into the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation of the PVC.
    This will cause the PVC to match the right storage class if the cluster has StorageClasses enabled by the admin.
  - If the user does not provide a storage class name or the cluster is version 1.3, then instead put a `volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class: default` annotation on the PVC.
    - This will cause a PV to be automatically provisioned for the user with sane default characteristics on some clusters.
    - Despite the word `alpha` in the name, the code behind this annotation has `beta` level support.
    - Do not use `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class:` with any value including the empty string since it will prevent DefaultStorageClass admission controller
      from running if enabled.
- In your tooling, do watch for PVCs that are not getting bound after some time and surface this to the user, as this may indicate that the cluster has no dynamic
  storage support (in which case the user should create a matching PV) or the cluster has no storage system (in which case the user cannot deploy config requiring
  PVCs).
- In the future, we expect most clusters to have `DefaultStorageClass` enabled, and to have some form of storage available.  However, there may not be any
  storage class names which work on all clusters, so continue to not set one by default.
  At some point, the alpha annotation will cease to have meaning, but the unset `storageClass` field on the PVC
  will have the desired effect.
