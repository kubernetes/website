title: Local Kubernetes development with LXD
---

{% capture overview %}
Running Kubernetes locally has obvious development advantages, such as lower cost and faster iteration than constantly deploying and tearing down clusters on a public cloud. Ideally, a Kubernetes developer can spawn all necessary nodes inside local containers and test new configurations as they are committed. This page will show you how to deploy a cluster to LXD containers on a local machine.
{% endcapture %}

The purpose of using [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/) on a local machine is to emulate the same deployment that a user would use in a cloud or bare metal. Each node is treated as a machine, with the same characteristics as production. Each node is a separate container, which runs Docker containers and `kubectl` inside (see [Cluster Intro](/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/cluster-intro/) for more info).

{% capture prerequisites %}
Install [conjure-up](http://conjure-up.io/), a tool for deploying big software.
    
```
    sudo snap install conjure-up --classic
```

Note: If conjure-up asks you to "Setup an ipv6 subnet" with LXD, answer NO. ipv6 with Juju/LXD is currently unsupported.

## Deploying Kubernetes

Start the deployment with:

    conjure-up kubernetes

For this walkthrough we are going to create a new controller - select the `localhost` Cloud type:

Deploy the applications:

![Deploy Applications](/images/docs/ubuntu/01-deploy.png)

Wait for Juju bootstrap to finish:

Wait for our Applications to be fully deployed:

![Waiting](/images/docs/ubuntu/03-waiting.png)

Run the final post-processing steps to automatically configure your Kubernetes environment:

Review the final summary screen:

## Accessing the Cluster 

You can access your Kubernetes cluster by running the following:
    
    
    kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config
    

Or if you've already run this once it'll create a new config file as shown in the summary screen.
    
    
    kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config.conjure-up
