## Overview

kubectl is the command line tool you use to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

You should use a version of kubectl that is at least as new as your server.
`kubectl version` will print the server and client versions.  Using the same version of kubectl
as your server naturally works; using a newer kubectl than your server also works; but if you use
an older kubectl with a newer server you may see odd validation errors .

## Download a release

Download kubectl from the [official Kubernetes releases](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/kubernetes-release/release/):

On MacOS:

```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.4.4/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x kubectl
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

On Linux:

```shell
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.4.4/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x kubectl
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```


You may need to `sudo` the `mv`; you can put it anywhere in your `PATH` - some people prefer to install to `~/bin`.


## Alternatives

### Download as part of the Google Cloud SDK

kubectl can be installed as part of the Google Cloud SDK:

First install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

After Google Cloud SDK installs, run the following command to install `kubectl`:

```shell
gcloud components install kubectl
```

Do check that the version is sufficiently up-to-date using `kubectl version`.

### Install with brew

If you are on MacOS and using brew, you can install with:

```shell
brew install kubectl
```

The homebrew project is independent from kubernetes, so do check that the version is
sufficiently up-to-date using `kubectl version`.


# Enabling shell autocompletion

kubectl includes autocompletion support, which can save a lot of typing!

The completion script itself is generated by kubectl, so you typically just need to invoke it from your profile.

Common examples are provided here, but for more details please consult `kubectl completion -h`

## On Linux, using bash

To add it to your current shell: `source <(kubectl completion bash)`

To add kubectl autocompletion to your profile (so it is automatically loaded in future shells):

```shell
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## On MacOS, using bash

On MacOS, you will need to install the bash-completion support first:

```shell
brew install bash-completion
```

To add it to your current shell:

```shell
source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```

To add kubectl autocompletion to your profile (so it is automatically loaded in future shells):

```shell
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "source <(kubectl completion bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```
