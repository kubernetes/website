## Installing Weave Net addon

Follow the [Integrating Kubernetes via the Addon](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kube-addon/) guide.

The Weave Net Addon for Kubernetes comes with a [Network Policy Controller](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kube-addon/#npc) that automatically monitors Kubernetes for any NetworkPolicy annotations on all namespaces and configures `iptables` rules to allow or block traffic as directed by the policies.

{% capture example %}

## Namespace isolation example

1. Create a namespace with `DefaultDeny`.

```yaml
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myns
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-policy: |
      {
        "ingress": {
          "isolation": "DefaultDeny"
        }
      }
```

2. Create 2 pods inside this namespace.

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pod1
  namespace: myns
  labels:
    inns: "yes"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pod1
    image: nginx
---
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pod2
  namespace: myns
  labels:
    inns: "yes"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: pod2
    image: nginx
```

3. Get the IP addresses of the pods.

```shell
kubectl get po -n myns -o wide
```
**Note:** If your cURL requests to pods are forbidden, try making cURL requests to other pods from within a pod.
{: .note}

4. Create a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy that allows pods within the same namespace to connect with each other.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: aaa
  namespace: myns
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - {key: inns, operator: In, values: ["yes"]}
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
             matchExpressions:
               - {key: inns, operator: In, values: ["yes"]}
```
**Caution:** After applying the network policy, pods outside the namespace you specify may be unable to connect with pods inside the namespace.
{. :caution}

Once you have installed the Weave Net addon, you can follow the [Declare Network Policy](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/declare-network-policy/) to try out Kubernetes NetworkPolicy.
