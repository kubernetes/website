The Weave Net Addon for Kubernetes comes with a [Network Policy Controller](https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kube-addon/#npc) that automatically monitors Kubernetes for any NetworkPolicy annotations on all namespaces and configures `iptables` rules to allow or block traffic as directed by the policies.
