# OPA supports a high-level declarative language named Rego for authoring and
# enforcing policies. For more infomration on Rego, visit
# http://openpolicyagent.org.

# Rego policies are namespaced by the "package" directive.

# Imports provide aliases for data inside the policy engine. In this case, the
# policy simply refers to "clusters" below.

# The "annotations" rule generates a JSON object containing the key
# "federation.kubernetes.io/replica-set-preferences" mapped to <preferences>.
# The preferences values is generated dynamically by OPA when it evaluates the
# rule.
#
# The SchedulingPolicy Admission Controller running inside the Federation API
# server will merge these annotatiosn into incoming Federated resources. By
# setting replica-set-preferences, we can control the placement of Federated
# ReplicaSets.
#
# Rules are defined to generate JSON values (booleans, strings, objects, etc.)
# When OPA evaluates a rule, it generates a value IF all of the expressions in
# the body evaluate successfully. All rules can be understood intuitively as
# <head> if <body> where <body> is true if <expr-1> AND <expr-2> AND ...
# <expr-N> is true (for some set of data.)
